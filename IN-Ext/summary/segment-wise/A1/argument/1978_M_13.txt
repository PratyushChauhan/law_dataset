learned counsel for the appellants has contended that the high court has adopted an erroneous view of the scope and ambit of the inquiry contemplated under s 24i of the act by the competent authority. according to learned counsel the mere circumstance that the respondent 's jagir was found under s 24 i to be proprietary was not tantamount to the establishment by the respondent of his rights to mines and mineral products in the villages of his jagir for which there must be an actual grant or contract or law or custom or usage recognising such rights and this could only be determined by the collector by holding an inquiry under s 372 of the bombay land revenue code and therefore the high court was clearly in error in coming to the conclusion that the inquiry initiated by the second appellant under s 372 of the bombay land revenue code was incompetent or without jurisdiction. on the other hand learned counsel for the respondent contended that a determination under s 2 4 i of the act that a particular jagir was a proprietary one necessarily implied that the grant was of soil and the grantee was entitled to mines and mineral products which were expressly saved under s 10 of the act and in any event on the facts obtaining in the instant case the competent authority acting under s 2 4 i of the act while coming to the conclusion that the respondent 's jagir was proprietary one bad relied upon the unqualified nature of the grant and also considered the evidence led before it touching upon the several rights. according to the learned counsel for the respondent unless a claim to property or rights over property was made either by the state against any person or by any person against the state there could be no occasion for the collector to held an inquiry contemplated by s 372 of the code. he therefore urged that the high court was right in quashing the collector 's order.
