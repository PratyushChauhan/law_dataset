section 24 of the orissa estates abolition act 1951 stipulates that the compensation shall be determined for the estate as a whole and not separately for each of the shares therein. section 26 has great relevance as it lays down the method of arriving at the gross asset and section 27 has like significance as it focuses on the manner in which the net income from an estate shall be computed by deducting certain items from the gross asset of the estate. section 28 states how the amount of compensation is to be determined and the methodology of payment. there are a few other s s in chapter vi which deal with payment of compensation. the act also provides for appeal second appeal and revision the last being to the high court and the earlier ones being to the collector and a board constituted under section 22. the rule making power is vested in the government under section 47 and there is a routine removal of difficulties clause contained in section 50. the policy of the law of agrarian reform postulates the extinguishment of ancient privileges and cornering of land resources and the socioeconomic yardstick is different from what applies to ordinary purchases of real estate and this is manifest in the special provisions contained in article 31a and article 31b of the constitution.
