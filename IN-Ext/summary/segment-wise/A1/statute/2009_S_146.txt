section 299 and section 300 ipc deals with the definition of culpable homicide and murder respectively. section 299 defines culpable homicide as the act of causing death i with the intention of causing death or ii with the intention of causing such bodily injury as is likely to cause death or iii with the knowledge that such act is likely to cause death the bare reading of the section makes it crystal clear that the first and the second clause of the section refer to intention apart from the knowledge and the third clause refers to knowledge alone and not intention both the expression intent and knowledge postulate the existence of a positive mental attitude which is of different degrees. the mental element in culpable homicide i e mental attitude towards the consequences of conduct is one of intention and knowledge. if that is caused in any of the aforesaid three circumstances the offence of culpable homicide is said to have been committed. 300 ipc however deals with murder although there is no clear definition of murder provided in section 300 ipc. it has been repeatedly held by this court that culpable homicide is the genus and murder is species and that all murders are culpable homicide but not vice versa. section 300 ipc further provides for the exceptions which will constitute culpable homicide not amounting to murder and punishable section. when and if there is intent and knowledge then the same would be a case of section 304 part i and if it is only a case of knowledge and not the intention to cause murder and bodily injury then the same would be a case of section 304 part ii. the aforesaid distinction between an act amounting to murder and an act not amounting to murder has been brought out in the numerous decisions of this court.
