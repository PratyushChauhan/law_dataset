the authorities of the dri by a letter dated 28 02 2005 requested the bank to defreeze the bank accounts of appellant. the said documents in our opinion were material. it was therefore difficult to appreciate why order of detention could not be passed on the basis of the materials gathered by them. it is no doubt true that if the delay is sufficiently explained the same would not be a ground for quashing an order of detention under cofeposa but as in this case a major part of delay remains unexplained. delay as is well known at both stages has to be explained. the court is required to consider the question having regard to the overall picture. the authorities of dri themselves categorically stated that the activities of appellant after 11 10 2003 were not in question and in fact all the bank accounts were defreezed. although learned additional solicitor general may be correct in his submissions that ordinarily we should not exercise our discretionary jurisdiction u art 136 of the constitution of india by allowing appellant to raise new grounds but in the courtâ€ ™ s opinion they have to do so as an order of detention may have to be considered from a different angle. it may be true that the period of detention is over. it may further be true that appellant had remained in detention for the entire period but it is one thing to say that the writ of habeas corpus in this circumstances can not issue but it is another thing to say that an order of detention is required to be quashed so as to enable the detainee to avoid his civil liabilities under safema as also protect his own reputation. in a case of this nature we do not think in view of the admitted facts that we would not permit appellant to raise the said questions. the statements of appellant and the said prabhjot singh were recorded therein in extenso. recording of such statement must have been made from the xeroxed copies of such documents which were available with the detaining authority. the self inculpatory statements of appellant as also prabhjot singh purported to have been made in terms of s 108 of the customs act were required to be considered before the order of detention could be passed. the same was not done. the original of such documents might not been available with the detaining authority but admittedly the xeroxed copies were. it has not been denied or disputed that even the xeroxed copies of the said documents had not been supplied to the detenue. it may be true that appellant in his representation dated 14 06 2005 requested for showing him the original documents referred to or mentioned in the grounds of detention but then at least the xeroxed copies thereof should have been made available to him. it is a trite law that all documents which are not material are not necessary to be supplied. what is necessary to be supplied is the relevant and the material documents but thus all relevant documents must be supplied so as to enable the detenue to make an effective representation which is his fundamental right u art 225 of the constitution of india. right to make an effective representation is also a statutory right see sunila jain vs 2006 3 scc 321 2006 indlaw sc 65. in this case the statements of appellant and prabhjot singh were material. they could not have been withheld. if original of the said documents were not available xeroxed copies thereof could have been made available to him. the detaining authority moreover while relying on the said documents in one part of the order of detention could not have stated in another part that he was not relying thereupon. the very fact that he had referred to the said statements in ex tenso is itself a pointer to the fact that he had relied upon the said documents. even in the earlier part of the impugned order of detention i e detaining authority appears to have drawn his own conclusions.
