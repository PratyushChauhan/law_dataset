the provision contained in the act being stringent in nature the purport and intent thereof must be ascertained having regard to the purpose and object it seeks to achieve. the right of a person notified to file an application or to raise a defence that he is not liable in terms of the provisions of the act or in any event the properties attached should not be sold in discharge of the liabilities can be taken at the initial stage by filing an application in terms of sub section 2 of section 4 of the act. but at the stage when liabilities are required to be discharged the notified person may inter alia raise a contention inter alia for the purpose of establishing that the properties held and possessed by them are sufficient to meet their liabilities. in terms of the provisions of the act the special court had been conferred a very wide power. the appellants herein are notified persons in terms of the provisions of the act therefore all the properties belonging to them stand attached such attachment being automatic no finding was required to be arrived at that the same had been acquired either during the notified period or the appellants were involved in offences in transactions in securities. in tejkumar balakrishna ruia vs a k menon and another 1997 9 scc 123 1996 indlaw sc 2403 this court held in their view the terms of sub section 3 of section 3 are clear by reason thereof the property that belongs to a notified person stands attached simultaneously with the issue of the notification that makes him a notified party the words on and from the date of notification indicate the point of time at which the attachment takes effect this is reiterated by the words shall stand attached simultaneously with the issue of the notification. this also indicates that no separate notification or order in regard to the attachment is necessary. neither the words on and from the date of notification nor the word property lead to the conclusion that what is attached is not only that property which the notified person owned or was possessed of on the date of the notification but also all such property as he might acquire at any time thereafter. the intention to attach property which did not belong to the notified person on the date of the notification but which he might acquire later would had it been there have been clearly expressed and sub section 3 would have stated that such property would stand attached the moment it was acquired by the notified person. the act would also have made provision for a subsistence allowance or the like for the notified person it seems to us that to give to section 33 the wide meaning that has been ascribed to it in the judgment and order under appeal would render it perilously close to being held unconstitutional for it would deprive the notified person so long as he remained a notified person from earning a livelihood. even to say that such interpretation would reduce a notified person to beggary would not be accurate because the alms that he received being his property would stand attached the apprehension expressed by the special court does not appear to be well founded if what a notified person obtains by way of purported income or gift or inheritance is really his own money such money would upon establishment of the fact stand attached automatically under the provisions of section 33. in any event it is for parliament to enact a law that meets all contingencies the courts must interpret the law as it reads. while a purposive interpretation is permissible where two interpretations are possible the purposive interpretation must be such as preserves the constitutionality of the provision. it is no doubt true that the law of limitation bars a remedy but not a right

proper for us to consider as to whether such a remedy being not available in terms of section 42 of the act can still be determined if raised by way of defence. in l s synthetics ltd 2004 indlaw sc 715 supra this court observed a statute of limitation bars a remedy and not a right although a remedy is barred a defence can be raised in construing a special statute providing for limitation consideration of plea of hardship is irrelevant a special statute providing for special or no period of limitation must receive a liberal and broader construction and not a rigid or a narrow one the intent and purport of parliament enacting the said act furthermore must be given its full effect we are therefore of the opinion that the provisions of the limitation act have no application so far as directions required to be issued by the special court relating to the disposal of attached property are concerned. although the court did not intend to enter into the correctness or otherwise of the said contention of the appellants at this stage however there can not be any doubt whatsoever that they being notified persons all their properties would be deemed to be automatically attached as a consequent thereto for the said purpose it is not necessary that they should be accused of commission of an offence as such. the principle of lifting the corporate veil however ipso facto would not apply to the individuals. the custodian in a case of this nature may however show that the transactions entered into apparently by harshad mehta were intimately connected with acquisition of properties in the name of others. a transaction of benami indisputably can be a subject matter of a lies in terms of section 41 of the act as and when such a question is raised the same may have to be dealt with by the special court appropriately. however nexus between several persons in dealing with the matter may be established by the custodian. the fact however remains that the copies of the documents books of accounts and other records on the basis whereof the auditors appointed by the court filed their reports had not been shown to the appellants herein on the premise that they were in know of the things. as the said question has not been gone into by the learned judge special court it is necessary that the same be considered and appropriately dealt with. if the liabilities of the individual entities are not treated as that of the group for one reason or the other indisputably liability of those who have nothing to do with the dealings of harshad mehta either in their individual capacities or as directors of some company or otherwise must be dealt with separately. a finding of fact arrived at upon discussing and analyzing the respective contentions could have gone a long way in assisting this court in arriving at a correct conclusion. the learned judge proceeded on the basis that the assets and liabilities joint and collective of all those who are related with harshad mehta as also the corporate entities in which he was a director or had some other interest must be considered as a group. even in this behalf it was necessary for the special judge to assign sufficient and cogent reasons. it was thus necessary for the learned special court to arrive at a firm conclusion as regard the involvement of the individuals with harshad mehta if any and the extent of his liability as such. furthermore the question as regard liability of the parties should have been determined at the stage of section 9 a of the act. in kedarnath jute mfg co ltd 1971 indlaw sc 841 supra this court has held although that liability can not be enforced till the quantification is effected by assessment proceedings the liability for payment of tax is independent of the assessment it is significant that in the present case the liability had even been quantified and a demand had been created in the sum of rs 149776 by means of the notice dated november 21 1957 during the pendency of the assessment proceedings before the income tax officer and before the finalisation of the assessment it is not possible to comprehend how the liability would cease to be one because the assessee had taken proceedings before higher authorities for getting it reduced or wiped out so long as the contention of the assessee did not prevail with regard to the quantum of liability etc. in board of control for cricket in india and another vs netaji cricket club and others 2005 4 scc 741 2005 indlaw sc 1243 this court held it is also not correct to contend that the court while exercising its review jurisdiction in any situation whatsoever can not take into consideration a subsequent event in a case of this nature when the court accepts its own mistake in understanding the nature and purport of the undertaking given by the learned senior counsel appearing on behalf of the board and its correlation with as to what transpired in the agm of the board held on 29 9 2004 the subsequent event may be taken into consideration by the court for the purpose of rectifying its own mistake. in janak raj vs gurdial singh and anr 1967 2 scr 77 1966 indlaw sc 120 this court confirmed a sale in favour of the appellant therein who was a stranger to the suit being the auction purchaser of the judgment debtor 's immovable property in execution of an ex parte money decree in terms of order xxxi rule 92 civil procedure code. despite the fact that ordinarily a sale can be set aside only under rules 89 90 and 91 of order xxxi it was opined that the court is bound to confirm the sale and direct the grant of a certificate vesting the title in the purchaser as from the date of sale when no application in term of rule 92 was made or when such application was made and disallowed and in support thereof zain ul abdin khan 1887 indlaw pc 13 supra and various other decisions were referred to.
