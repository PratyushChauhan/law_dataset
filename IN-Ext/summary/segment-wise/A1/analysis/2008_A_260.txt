patents amendment act2005for the first time a dichotomy was introduced in the patent law between opposition to the pre grant and opposition to the post grant of patent. this was the major structural change in the patent law. similarly under the patents amendment act2005appeal was restricted to the post grant opposition orders and that appeal lay before the appellate board and not to the high court here also s 25 of the patents act1970 as amended by patents amendment act2005 whereas amended section 117a by which appeal was provided for against post grant opposition order was not brought into force 2007. on 19 10 2006 when fao no 29306 was filed in the high court chapter xix of the parent act as amended vide patents amendment act1999 continued to be in operation notwithstanding the enactment of the patents amendment act2002 and the patents amendment act2005 as the amended ss 116 and 117a were brought into force only vide notification dated 2 4 07. quite often the commencement of an act is postponed to some specific future date or to such date as the appropriate government may by notification in the official gazette appoint. an act can not be said to commence or to be in force unless it is brought into operation by legislative enactment or by the exercise of authority by a delegate empowered to bring it into operation. s 251 is wider than s 252 as the latter is available only to a person aggrieved. the main difference between s 251 and s 252as brought about by patents amendment act2005is that even after a patent is grantedpost grant opposition can be filed under s 25 2 for a period of one year. the reason is obvious. in relation to patents that are of recent origin a higher scrutiny is necessary. this is the main rationale underlying s 252 of the said 1970 act. therefore the legislature intended an appeal under section 117a2 to the appellate board from any decision order or direction of the controller inter alia under s 254. the legislature intended to provide for two types of scrutiny followed by one statutory appeal to the appellate board against post grant proceedings. the legislature intended to have a dichotomy between pre grant opposition and post grant opposition. however the legislature intended that there shall be only one statutory appeal against grant of patent. it was left to the executive to bring the enacted law into force vide notification. for some unknown reasons the amended ss 116 and 117a2 were not brought into force till 2 4 07 whereas the concept of pre grant and post grant oppositions were brought into force w e f 1 1 2005. this is where the legislative intent got defeated during the interregnum. it is during this interregnum that respondent no 3 filed its fao no 29306 in the high court under section 116as it stood on 19 10 06 under the patents amendment act1999. on that date the amended section 117a suggested by patents amendment act2005was not brought into force. on 19 10 06 the old law prevailed under which an appeal lay before the high court respondent no 3in both the cases preferred first appeals to the high court u s 116 as it then stood. they are fao no 29206 and fao no 29306. the court to decide the fate of these pending appeals one more aspect needs to be mentioned. under the patents amendment act2005appeal is provided to the appellate board against the order of the controller under s 254. however that statutory appeal is maintainable only in post grant opposition proceedings whereas respondent no 3 herein has instituted first appeals under the law then prevailing challenging the order rejecting pre grant opposition. there is no point in transferring the pending fao no 29206 and fao no 29306 to the appellate board which has no authority to decide matters concerning pre grant opposition. moreover it may be noted that even section 117g which refers to transfer of pending proceedings to the appellate board is also brought into force vide notification dated 3 4 07 keeping in mind the peculiar nature of the problem in hand the court was of the view that ends of justice would be sub served if the high court is directed to hear and decide the appeals bearing fao no 29206 and fao no 29306 in accordance with law as it then stood i e u s 116 under patents amendment act1999 against orders passed by the controller in pre grant opposition proceedings.
