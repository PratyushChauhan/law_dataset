considering the entire scheme of the code and the provisions contained in sections 257 and 259the court was of the definite opinion that the minister concerned of the state government can entertain second revision to satisfy the legality and propriety of the order passed by the revenue officer. the division bench of the bombay high court has elaborately discussed the question and passed the impugned order holding that section 257 confers jurisdiction to the state government to entertain its revision against the order passed by any revenue officer either in appeal or in revision. the court found no infirmity in the impugned order passed by the high court. hence this appeal has no merit which is accordingly dismissed. the parties may prosecute their remedies in civil court in accordance with law.
