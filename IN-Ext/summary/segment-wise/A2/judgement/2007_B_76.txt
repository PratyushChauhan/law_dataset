though performance of the charter party agreement may have come to an end on 31st august1998 but it was still in existence for some purposes viz the effect of vessel s non re delivery as per the prescribed mechanism and its continued use beyond the stipulated time and thus the arbitration clause in the said charter party operated in respect of these and other allied purposes. therefore the factual scenario leads to an inescapable conclusion that notwithstanding the expiry of the period fixed in the time charter party dated 6th may1997the said charter party did not get extinguished inter alia for the purpose of determination of the disputes arising thereunder and the arbitration clause contained therein could be invoked by the respondent. in view of the foregoing discussion the court did not find any infirmity in the view taken by the high court that charter party dated 6th may1997 had not come to an end by efflux of time and it got extended by the conduct of the parties warranting interference. that it would be proper and expedient to constitute a fresh arbitral tribunal. accordingly this court constituted an arbitral tribunal to adjudicate upon the claim counter claim by the parties subject to their consent and such terms and conditions as they may deem fit and proper. the registry is directed to communicate this order to the learned members of the arbitral tribunal to enable them to enter upon the reference and decide the matter as expeditiously as practicable. appeal dismissed.
