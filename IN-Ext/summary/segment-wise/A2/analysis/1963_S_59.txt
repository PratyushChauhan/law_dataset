section 120 b provides that whoever is a party to a criminal conspiracy to commit an offence punishable with death imprisonment for life or rigorous imprisonment for a term of two years or upwards shall be punishable in the same manner as if he has abetted such offence unless there was an express provision in the code for the punishment of such conspiracy. the first charge is in respect of the conspiracy alleged to have been entered into by the two respondents k vs ramana the approver and others known and unknown to commit criminal breach of trust of the funds of vesco and in order to screen its detection to falsify the accounts of vesco and to use forged documents as genuine. on the face of it this is a valid charge. but certain objections have been taken to it with which the court will deal at the appropriate place. the second charge is for an offence of criminal breach of trust punishable under section 409 and the accusation therein is that the two respondents along with ramana misappropriated 69 items aggregating to a little over rs 3 20 000. it is clear from the charge that some of the amounts were misappropriated between april 1947 and march 1950 some between april 1947 and march 1949 some between april 1947 and march 1951 and quite a large number between september 1947 and march 1950 and a still large number between april 1951 and march 1952. it is thus apparent that offences committed within a space of 12 months were tried along with offences committed beyond that period. unless therefore the provisions of section 239 are applicable it would follow that there was a misjoinder of charges. the third charge is that the two respondents along with the approver ramana made false entries on seven different dates in the account books between september 19 1947 and march 18 1952 and thus committed an offence under section 477 a i p c. the fourth charge is that the two respondents along with the approver ramana forged six documents on different dates between march 28 1949 and november 12 1951 and thus committed an offence under section 471 read with section 467 i p c. in coming to the conclusion that the provisions of various clauses of section 239 can not be applied cumulatively the high court has relied upon the decision in re vankavalapati gopala rao 1956 airandhra 21. there the learned judges have held that these clauses are mutually exclusive and they can not be simultaneously applied and to construe them as supplementing each other would be enlarging the scope of the exceptions. each clause is an exception to the general rule enacted in section 233 cr p c. if such a combination is permissible all persons accused of offences described in cls a to g can be tried together in one case which certainly involves a bewildering multiplicity of charges and which would obviously set at naught the salutary principle contained in section 233. s 236 is a special provision available in case of doubt and is neither subject to the limitations prescribed by section 233 nor those of the other preceding provisions. now if the respondent no 1 were alone tried upon the second third and the fourth charges the provisions of section 2351 could have been pressed in aid if the allegations were that the offences were so connected together as to form one and the same transaction and the validity of the trial would not have been open to any attack. similarly if the second respondent were alone tried on the second charge his trial would not have been open to any objection if the allegation were that the offences were so connected together as to form the same transaction. here however the court a case where the prosecution alleges that there was additionally a conspiracy to which apart from the two respondents the approver and some other persons were parties and where in both the respondents were tried together. a conspiracy must be regarded as one transaction and therefore a single individual charged with it could be tried with the aid of section 2351 for all the acts committed by him in furtherance or in pursuance of the conspiracy without the limitations imposed by s 2341. for where all the acts are referable to the same conspiracy their connection with one another is obvious. the only provision in the code which permits the joint trial of more than one person is section 239 and what the court to see is whether under that provision the two respondents could have been jointly tried for the offences with which they were charged. let us therefore examine closely the provisions of section 239. on the other hand at the end of cl f there is a conjunction and. now since section 2341 can not be properly read overriding section 2351 there is no valid reason for construing it as overriding the provisions of section 239 either. s 239 must be read at least subject to sections 2341 and 2351 on the ground that if there are certain restrictions with respect to the trial of a single accused there is no reason why those restrictions will disappear if an accused person is tried along with several other persons. thus where several persons are accused of more offences than one of the same kind committed by them jointly within a period of 12 months the number of offences for which they could be tried can not exceed three. in this connection he relied upon the words within the meaning of section 224 occurring in cl c of section 239. these words clearly show that cl c of section 239 is subject to the provisions of section 234. in the courtâ€ ™ s opinion the words within the meaning of section 234 indicate that what was meant by the words offence of the same kind persons accused of more offences than one of the same kind not exceeding three in numberor may have used the words person accused of more than one offence of the same kind to the extent permissible under section 234. therefore even if the expression same transaction alone had been used in section 2351 it would have meant a transaction consisting either of a single act or of a series of connected acts. the expression same transaction occurring in cls a c and d of section 239 as well as that occurring in section 2351 ought to be given the same meaning according to the normal rule of construction of statutes. looking at the matter in that way it is pointless to inquire further whether the provisions of section 239 are subject to those of section 2361. the provisions of sub section 2 and 3 of section 235 are enabling provisions and quite plainly can have no overriding effect. but it would be open to the court to resort to those provisions even in the case of a joint trial of several persons permissible under section 239 s 236 is also an enabling provision to be availed of in case of doubt and it is meaningless to say that section 239 is subject to section 236. bearing in mind the fact that the provisions in the former part of chapter xix are applicable to charges made with the aid of section 239 only so far as may be it would not be right to construe section 239 as being subject to the provisions of sections 233 to 236. it was contended by mr chari that the expression former part would apply to the first sub division of chapter xix which deals with the form and content of the charges and the powers of the court with regard to the absence of charge and alteration of charge. the court could not however give the expression such a restricted meaning. for even in the absence of those words the earlier provisions could not have been ignored. for it is a rule of construction that all the provisions of a statute are to be read together and given effect to and that it is therefore the duty of the court to construe a statute harmoniously. thus while it is clear that the sections preceding section 239 have no overriding effect on that section the courts are not to ignore them but apply such of them as can be applied without detracting from the provisions of s 239. indeed the very expression so far as may be emphasises the fact that while the earlier provisions have to be borne in mind by the court while applying section 239 it is not those provisions but the latter which is to have an overriding effect. criminal conspiracy as defined in section 120 a and consists of an agreement to do an illegal act or an agreement to do an act which is not illegal by illegal means. criminal conspiracy was however not an unknown thing before the amendment of the indian penal code in 1913. but what the amendment did was to make that conspiracy itself punishable the idea was to prevent the commission of crimes by so to speak nipping them in the bud. but it does not follow that where crimes have been committed the liability to punishment already incurred under section 120 b by having entered into a criminal conspiracy is thereby wiped away. no doubt as already stated where offences for committing which a conspiracy was entered into have actually been committed it may not in the particular circumstances of a case be desirable to charge the offender both with the conspiracy and the offences committed in pursuance of that conspiracy. but that would be a matter ultimately within the discretion of the court before which the trial takes place. in so far as the fourth point is concerned that would have a bearing not on the form of the charge but on the credibility of the evidence bearing on the point of conspiracy. the prosecution be established by reference to section 34 of the indian evidence act which reads thus as what it does is to make entries in books of account regularly kept in the course of business relevant in all proceedings in a court of law. these entries are however not by themselves sufficient to charge any person with liability. therefore when a sues b for a sum of money it is open to him to put his account books in evidence provided they are regularly kept in the course of business and show by reference to them that the amount claimed by him is debited against b. the entry though made by a in his own account books and though it is in his own favour is a piece of evidence which the court may take into consideration for the purpose of determining whether the amount referred to therein was in fact paid by a to b. the entry by itself is of no help to a in his claim against b but it can be considered by the court along with the evidence of a for drawing the conclusion that the amount was paid by a to b. to this limited extent entries in the account books are relevant and can be proved section 34 does not go beyond that. it says nothing about non existence of entries in account books. the court therefore agree with the high court that the account books of the various concerns to whom payments are said to have been made by the respondents are not by themselves evidence of the fact that no payments were received by them. the decision in queen empress vs grees chunder banerjee 1884 i l r 10 cal 1024 upon which reliance is placed by the high court in support of its view is also to that effect similarly in ram prashad singh vs lakhpati koer 1902 i l r 30 cal 231 247. lord robertson during the course of the hearing has observed that no inference can be drawn from the absence of any entry relating to any particular matter which observation supports the view taken in queen empress vs girish chander banerjee 1884 i l r 10 c l 1024. there is section ii of the evidence act which provides that facts not otherwise relevant are relevant if they are inconsistent with any fact in issue or relevant fact. some of the facts in issue in this case are whether payments of certain sums of money were made to crompton engineering co and other firms or authorities. absence of entries in their account books would be inconsistent with the receipt of the accounts and would thus be a relevant fact which can be proved under section 11. the fact that no payments were received by those firms has been deposed to by persons connected with those firms and whose duty it was to receive and acknowledge amounts received by the firms or who were in charge of the accounts of these firms. for the purpose of showing that no amounts were received by the firms their account books would thus be as relevant as the vesco account books for the purpose of showing the contrary. there is section 5 of the evidence act which reads thus as it is the case of the prosecution that the alleged payments were never made by vesco to the various firms. the offence under section 467 read with section 471 is punishable with imprisonment for life or imprisonment of either description for a period of 10 years but it is exclusively triable by a court of session. as regards the offence under section 477 a it is one of those sections which are specifically enumerated in section 337 1 and the argument advanced before the court and which the court rejected would not even be available with regard to the pardon in respect of that offence. it is true that the respondent no i alone was convicted by the additional sessions judge of this offence and the offence under section 467 read with section 471 but the validity of a pardon is to be determined with reference to the offence alleged against the approver alone and not with reference to the offence or offences for which his associates were ultimately convicted. the decision in sarwan singh vs the state of punjab 1957 b c r 953 on which reliance has been placed by the high court has been explained by this court in the case of maj e g barsay vs the state of bombay. this court has pointed out in the latter decision that while it must be shown that the approver is a witness of truth the evidence adduced in a case can not be considered in compartments and that even for judging the credibility of the approver the evidence led to corroborate him in material particulars would be relevant for consideration. the high court should bear this in mind for deciding whether the evidence of the approver should be acted upon or not. then again it would not be sufficient for the high court to deal with the evidence in a general way. it would be necessary for it to consider for itself the evidence adduced by the prosecution on the specific charges and then to conclude whether those charges have been established or not. the prosecution would be well advised if instead of placing the evidence on each and every one of those large number of charges against the respondents it chooses to select a few charges under each head other than the head of conspiracy and concentrates on establishing those charges this would save public time and also serve the purpose of the prosecution. the court set aside the acquittal of the respondents and remit the appeal to the high court for decision on merits in the light of our observations.
