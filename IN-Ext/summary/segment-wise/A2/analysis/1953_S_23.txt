it is quite true that a dedication may be either absolute or partial the property may be given out and out to the idol or it may be subjected to a charge in favour of the idol. what we find here in cl 3 of the will is an absolute dedication of the premises no 41 grey street to the idol as its permanent habitation with only the right given to the sevayats to reside in the said premises for the purposes of carrying on the daily and periodical seva and the festivals etc of the deity. they are to be registered in the municipal records in the name of the deity. there is thus a clear indication of the intention of the testator to absolutely dedicate the said premises to the deity and it is impossible to urge that there was a partial dedication of the premises to the deity. if nagendra was thus a sevayat of the idol it could not be urged that his possession could in any manner whatever be adverse to the idol and his dealings with the said premises in the manner he purported to do after the 12th october 1920 could not be evidence of any adverse possession against the idol.
