the appellants herein became permanent employees of the respondents having regard to the provisions contained in section 2 of the 1961 act and order 2i and 2vi of the standard standing orders as set out in the annexure appended to the 1963 rules defining permanent employees and the temporary employees. vacancies in fact had arisen after passing of the judgment of the high court and thus the services of the appellants should be regularized there against. the expression clear vacancies has to be read in the context of period for which the concerned workman was required to work namely six months. a seniority list was also drawn up and an employment code was assigned to each one of the appellants from which fact the nature of their employment should be judged. as the respondents despite direction to produce documents including the offers for appointment did not produce the same an adverse inference should have been drawn against them by the high court. as regard the claim of equal pay for equal work the learned counsel would urge that the high court has failed to consider the same in its true perspective. drawing this courtâ€ ™ s attention also to the pleadings as also the reliefs claimed for by the appellants before the labour court the learned counsel would contend that no contention was raised therein by the appellants as regard their entitlement of permanency in terms of the provisions of the 1961 act and the 1963 rules. furthermore from the reliefs claimed it would appear that the appellants had inter alia prayed for continuance of their services by the indore municipal corporation which knocks off the very basis of their claim.
