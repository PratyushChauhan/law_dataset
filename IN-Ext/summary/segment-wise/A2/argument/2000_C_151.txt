in so far as institutions imparting technical education were concerned the university or the state government had no independent role to play except to the extent provided in the above said enactment in the present case the aicte had made inspections and was satisfied that the necessary infrastructure was available and that the appellant would be able to conform to the required standards of the education. the aicte had consulted the state of kerala as well as the mahatma gandhi university. the university had granted conditional approval as stated earlier therefore the aicte constituted a task force and obtained its opinion and thereafter granted its approval subject to various conditions. the policy of the government was not to grant approval to self financing engineering colleges to be established such a policy could not come in the way of the appellant in view of what this court has stated in similar circumstances. the policy of the state of kerala at the relevant time was not to grant approval for establish ment of more engineering colleges in the state. the government had clarified in the counter affidavit filed in the high court that the government was not in a position to take a decision to start new engineering colleges without properly assessing the necessity of more engineering graduates from the state and without exploring the possibility of employment opportunities in the country as a whole.
