therein a charge under sections 376 and 302 ipc was sought to be substantiated on circumstantial evidence. one of the circumstantial evidence relied on was that a human blood stain of b group was found on the accused 's pant which blood group was also of the deceased. another circumstantial evidence relied on was that a stain of semen was found on the under pant of the accused. as regards the dried stain of semen on the appellant 's under pant the court observed that the accused was a grown up man of 30 years and no compelling inference could arise that the stain was caused during the course of the sexual assault committed by him on the victim girl. in the present case the age of the accused was about 21 years at the time of the incident. on his arrest he was subjected to medical examination and found to be a potent and capable person. presence of semen stain on underwear assuming that the underwear belonged to the accused though there is no evidence adduced in this regard is not by itself an incriminating piece of evidence connecting the accused with the crime in question.
