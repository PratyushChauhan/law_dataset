the points which he urged are briefly these. 1 that there was a misjoinder of charges and persons in that the various provisions of section 239 were clubbed together and an omnibus charge of conspiracy was framed which on its face was one likely to embarrass the respondents and make their task of defending themselves difficult. 2 the procedure adopted in the investigation and committal stages was irregular. 3 irrelevant evidence was introduced and some evidence was introduced in a manner not authorised by the evidence act. 4 that the court abused its powers under s 342 cr p c while conducting the examination of the respondents. 5 the evidence of the approver was inadmissible because the pardon granted to him was illegal that in any case it is unreliable was so found even by the sessions judge and must therefore be rejected. if the evidence of the approver is left out the remaining evidence would be inadequate to sustain the prosecution case. as many as 2 000 documents were dumped by the prosecution in this case out of which 1600 documents were not sought to be proved by it. further 64 documents were missing from the records when they came to the high court and that this has caused serious prejudice to the respondent.
