the grievance of the appellant state is that the high court while passing the impugned order has not noticed the liability incurred by the undertaking and the loan paid to the company. no amount whatsoever is due and payable by the company to the state. till date there has not been a single determination adjudication by any court authority of any dues against the company nor is there any claim pending before any authority or before any court on date. furthermore the state has not been able to produce any recovery certificate of any department showing any dues against the company. the collector has no power to adjudicate the dues under the u p zamindari abolition and land revenue act and is merely a recovery agent to recover sums payable as arrears of land revenue upon receipt of a valid recovery certificate.
