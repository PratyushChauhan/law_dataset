section 299 and section 300 ipc deals with the definition of culpable homicide and murder respectively. section 299 ipc defines culpable homicide as the act of causing death i with the intention of causing death or ii with the intention of causing such bodily injury as is likely to cause death or iii with the knowledge that such act is likely to cause death. section 300 ipc however deals with murder although there is no clear definition of murder provided in section 300 ipc. it has been repeatedly held by this court that culpable homicide is the genus and murder is species and that all murders are culpable homicide but not vice versa. section 300 ipc further provides for the exceptions which will constitute culpable homicide not amounting to murder and punishable section 304.
