The Supreme Court unanimously allows the appeal. The Court holds that Enviroco is not entitled to a contribution from Asco under section 3(2) of the 1940 Act because it cannot establish that if sued Asco might have been liable to Farstad in respect of losses caused by the fire. Lord Clarke delivered the leading judgment.
