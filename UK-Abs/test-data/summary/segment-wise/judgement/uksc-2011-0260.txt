The Supreme Court considers option (b) to be correct, and unanimously allows the appeals to the extent of declaring that a targets liability under the FSD regime, arising pursuant to an FSD issued after the company has gone into administration, ranks as a provable debt of the company, and does not rank as an expense of the administration. Lord Neuberger gives the main judgment of the Court, with which Lord Mance, Lord Clarke and Lord Toulson agree. Lord Sumption gives a short concurring judgment, with which Lord Mance and Lord Clarke agree.
