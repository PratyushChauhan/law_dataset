The Supreme Court gives an interim judgment. It is final as to the issues covered (issues (i)-(iii)), but interim in the sense that other issues will have to be decided (issues (iv)-(v)) before the appeal can be finally determined. Certain critical and difficult issues had not been clearly identified in the agreed statement of facts and issues, nor adequately covered by the written or oral submissions. In fairness to the parties and in order to reach a fully informed conclusion, the court sees no alternative but to invite further submissions on the matters identified in the interim judgment.
