The Supreme Court unanimously allows the appeal. Lord Hope and Lady Hale give the judgment of the Court. The Court holds that the sheriffs order of 27 October 2006 was not incompetent and so recalls the First Divisions interlocutor and dismisses the petition. The Court declares that section 93(2)(b)(c) of the Children (Scotland) Act 1995 should be read so as to include the words or who appears to have established family life with the child with which the decision of a childrens hearing may interfere. The Court makes a finding that K is a relevant person within the meaning of section 93(2)(b)(c) as so read.
