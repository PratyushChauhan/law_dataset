By a majority, the Supreme Court substantially agrees with the conclusion of the Court of Appeal, but because of further evidence from the prosecutions expert produced after the judgment of the Court of Appeal, it allows the appeal to the limited extent of remitting the matter to the judge for further consideration in the light of that further evidence and the judgment of this court. Lord Lloyd-Jones gives the majority judgment, with which Lady Hale, Lord Wilson and Lord Hodge agree. Lord Reed delivers a dissenting judgment.
