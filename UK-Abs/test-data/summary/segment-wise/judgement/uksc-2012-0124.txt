The Supreme Court unanimously dismisses Mr Guls appeal for reasons contained in a judgment given by Lord Neuberger and Lord Judge, with whom the other members of the Court agree. Mr Gul argued that both domestic law and international law required the statutory definition of terrorism to be interpreted narrowly, so as to exclude its application to situations such as those depicted in some of the videos which he had uploaded, namely those involving actions by non-state armed troops attacking foreign armed forces in their territory.
