The Supreme Court unanimously allows the appeal. Lord Hughes gives the only reasoned judgment, with which the other members of the court agree. The better reading of section 5 of the 1971 Act is that it does not revive prior leave on a deportation orders revocation. The other statutory provisions relied upon by Mr George do not support his case.
