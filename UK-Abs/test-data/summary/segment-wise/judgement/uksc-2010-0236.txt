The Supreme Court unanimously dismisses the appeal. There is no failure to comply with the European legal principles of effectiveness and legal certainty; the statutory limitation period is sufficiently clear, precise and foreseeable as to allow individuals to ascertain their rights and obligations and to exercise those rights without excessive difficulty. The judgment of the Court is given by Lord Mance.
