The Supreme Court unanimously allows the appeal. It holds that the general practice of not awarding costs in care proceedings against a party, including a local authority, in the absence of reprehensible behaviour or an unreasonable stance, should not be subject to an exception in the case of discrete fact- finding hearings. Lord Phillips delivers the judgment of the court.
