The Supreme Court unanimously dismisses Ns parents appeal. Although the Court of Protection had jurisdiction to continue with the planned hearing, it did not have power to order the respondent to fund the parents plan, nor to order the actual care providers to do that which they were unwilling or unable to do. The judge had therefore been entitled to conclude that no useful purpose was served by continuing the hearing. Lady Hale, with whom all the Justices agree, gives the only judgment.
