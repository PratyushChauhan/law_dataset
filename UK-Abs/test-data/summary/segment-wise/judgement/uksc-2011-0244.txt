The Supreme Court unanimously dismisses the appeal. There is no general rule that an authority such as the FSA, acting pursuant to a public law duty, should be required to give a cross-undertaking in respect of losses incurred by third parties. Further, there are no particular circumstances which mean that the FSA should be required to give such a cross-undertaking on the facts of this case. The judgment of the Court is given by Lord Mance.
