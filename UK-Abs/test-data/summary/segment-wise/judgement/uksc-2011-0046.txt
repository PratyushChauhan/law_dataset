The Supreme Court unanimously allows the appeal and restores the decision of the Employment Tribunal permitting the claims to be brought. The tribunal will now proceed to decide whether the appellants work is in fact of equal value to that of the comparators and, if so, whether there is an explanation other than the difference in sex for the difference between their terms and conditions. Lady Hale gives the only judgment.
