The correct approach to construction of the rules is well settled, as explained by Lord Brown in Mahed v Entry Clearance Officer [2010] 1 WLR 48. Read in accordance with those principles, it is clear that paragraph 352D does not cover AAs case and cannot be rewritten in order to do so [14-15]. Whether or not Kafala could be treated as a form of adoption for other purposes, the definition of adoptive parent in paragraph 6 is more restricted. It extends to de facto adoption only within the limitations laid down by paragraph 309A, which does not cover this case [15-16]. A number of international instruments call for a broad approach to the protection of the interests of children. The best interests principle is now, in appropriate areas of law, recognised both by domestic and international law [17]. However, taking them at their highest, there is no specific obligation covering the position of AA [18]. Subject to the issue of discrimination, there is no international obligation which goes further in practical terms than the protection which has been afforded to AA under human rights law [21]. It appears harsh that under the rules AA is treated less favourably than her adoptive siblings, largely because of the tragic circumstances in which parental responsibility passed to her brother-in-law, taken with the lack of any functioning legal system allowing for formal adoption in the country from which she comes. However, it is unnecessary to decide in the context of the present appeal whether or not such treatment could give rise to a claim for unlawful discrimination under article 14 ECHR or otherwise. This is because any rights which AA has in that respect would apply equally to her position in this country, regardless of the basis of her admission. In exercising any discretion in relation to the grant or extension of definite leave to remain, the Secretary of State is obliged to act in conformity with the Convention, including article 14. It is not necessary to reinterpret the rules to achieve that result [24].
