Three main conclusions follow from the contextual factors relevant to construing the Facilities Grant [22-24]. First, the intention was to confer a property right in the form of an easement [25]. Secondly, the grant was of a single comprehensive right to use a complex of facilities as they evolved, not fixed in 1981 [26-29]. Thirdly, there is no express requirement for contribution to the operational costs [30]. The effect of In re Ellenborough Park [1956] Ch 131 (CA) the leading case on easements on the central question in this appeal, namely whether the Facilities Grant could not amount to an easement because it conferred recreational and sporting rights, is fully discussed [44-57]. Lord Briggs concludes that Ellenborough Park establishes that such a grant can amount to an easement [48, 52-53, 59]. Overall, the majority accepts that the grant of an easement in this case was novel, given the greater running costs and operational responsibilities, and that there are factors which tell against broad recognition of rights over such facilities as easements [75]-[80]. Ultimately, however, the grant of purely recreational (including sporting) rights over land which genuinely accommodate adjacent land may be the subject matter of an easement, provided always that they satisfy the four well-settled conditions for easements [81]. Where the actual or intended use of the dominant tenement is itself recreational, as is the norm for holiday timeshare developments, the accommodation condition will generally be satisfied by a recreational easement [81]. Regarding the fourth condition whether the right is capable of forming the subject-matter of a grant other objections based on an ouster (the concern in this case being step-in rights of the dominant owner) and mere passivity (the issue being alleged positive duties on the servient owner) are not accepted by the majority, because of concurrent factual findings by the courts below [60-73]. On the cross-appeal, the majority holds that the Court of Appeal was wrong to limit the grant of rights to the facilities in existence at the time of the grant in 1981 [85, 92]. The sporting and recreational facilities referred to in the Facilities Grant were bound to change significantly over time [26, 86] and the new indoor swimming pool was, once complete, a facility made within the complex [88-92]. Lord Carnwaths dissenting judgment: Lord Carnwath considers that the intended enjoyment of the rights granted in this case, particularly as to the golf course and swimming pool, cannot be achieved without the active participation of the owner of those facilities in their provision, maintenance and management [95]. Thus, Lord Carnwath would not extend the Ellenborough Park principle to a full leisure complex. He considers that such an extension of the law on easements is wrong in principle and not supported by case law [96].
