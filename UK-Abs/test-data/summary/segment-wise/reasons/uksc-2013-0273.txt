The words of section 27 of the 1988 Act are wide enough to cover local authority landlords as well as public landlords, even though local authority landlords rarely perpetrate unlawful evictions of their tenants [15]. Section 28(1) requires the court to make two valuations, namely (a) and (b), of the landlords interest [16]. Valuation (a) is based on the assumption that the tenant continues to have the same right to occupy the premises, and the landlord continues to be subject to the same restrictions on recovering possession, as before the eviction occurred. Valuation (b) is based on the assumption that the tenants right to occupy and the restrictions on recovering possession have ceased [17]. The issue in this case was whether the valuation of both the upstairs and downstairs flats at 19 Moresby Walk (for valuation (a)) and of the upstairs flat (for valuation (b)) should be conducted on the assumption that they were subject to secure tenancies or to assured tenancies [24]. The assumption of a sale on the open market (subsection 28(3)(a)) is for the purposes of the valuations at subsection 28(1), in which other assumptions are mandated, namely (a) that the tenant continues to have the same right to occupy the premises as he had immediately prior to the eviction and, alternatively, (b) that he has ceased to have that right [26]. Prior to eviction, Mr Loveridges right to occupy the downstairs flat was that of a secure tenant. The notional exercise required by subsection 28(3)(a) does not extend to making adjustments to the nature of the tenants rights that are consequent upon sale. Such adjustments are barred by subsection 28(1)(a) which stipulates that the same right continues [27]. The likely effect upon a secure tenancy of a sale to a private landlord should not therefore be taken into account [28].
