In simple terms, the question is whether a public authority, when deciding whether to exercise a discretionary power to achieve a public objective, is entitled to take into account the cost to the public of so doing. As custodian of public funds, the authority not only may, but generally must, have regard to the cost to the public of its actions, at least to the extent of considering in any case whether the cost is proportionate to the aim to be achieved, and taking account of any more economic ways of achieving the same objective [24]-[25]. Section 97 of the Act requires no different approach. The section requires the authority to satisfy itself that revocation is expedient, and in so doing to have regard to the development plan and other material considerations. The development plan throws no light on the issue in this case. The word expedient implies no more than that the action should be appropriate in all the circumstances. Where one of those circumstances is a potential liability for compensation, it is hard to see why it should be excluded. Material in ordinary language is the same as relevant. Where the exercise of the power, in the manner envisaged by the statute, will have both planning and financial consequences, there is no obvious reason to treat either as irrelevant [26]. Under section 97, a planning authority has a discretion whether to act, and, if so, how. If it does decide to act, it must bear the financial consequences. Section 97 creates a specific statutory power to buy back a permission previously granted. Cost, or value for money, is naturally relevant to the purchasers consideration [51]. Sufficient consistency is given to the expression material considerations if it is treated as it is elsewhere in administrative law: that is, as meaning considerations material (or relevant) to the exercise of the particular power, in its statutory context and for the purposes for which it was granted. So read, there is no inconsistency between section 97 and other sections such as section 70 [49]-[50]. Furthermore, in exercising its choice not to act under section 97, or in choosing between that and other means of achieving its planning objective, the authority is to be guided by what is expedient. No principle of consistency requires that process to be confined to planning considerations, or to exclude cost [52]. The contrary view of Richards J in Alnwick DC v Secretary of State (2000) 79 P & CR 130 was wrong, although the actual decision may be supportable on its own facts [54]. Possible difficulty in assessing precisely the likely level of compensation is no reason for not conducting the exercise, still less for leaving cost considerations out of account altogether [55]-[56]. Accordingly, for reasons which essentially follow those of the majority of the Court of Appeal, the HSEs appeal is dismissed [57].
