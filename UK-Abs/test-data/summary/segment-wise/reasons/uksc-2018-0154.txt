Visa and Mastercard appeal on four grounds. First, whether the Court of Appeal was wrong to find that there was a restriction of competition in the acquiring market contrary to article 101(1) TFEU and equivalent national legislation (the restriction issue). Second, whether the Court of Appeal found, and if so was it wrong in finding, that Visa and Mastercard were required to satisfy a more onerous evidential standard than that normally applicable in civil litigation, in order to establish that their MIFs were exempt under article 101(3) (the standard of proof issue). Third, whether the Court of Appeal was wrong to find that in order to show that consumers receive a fair share of the benefits generated by the MIFs, to satisfy the test under article 101(3), Visa was required to prove that the benefits provided to merchants alone as a result of the MIFs outweighed the costs arising from the MIFs, without taking any account of the benefits received by cardholders as a result of the MIFs (the fair share issue). Fourth, whether the Court of Appeal found and, if so, was it wrong in finding, that a defendant has to prove the exact amount of loss mitigated in order to reduce damages (the broad axe issue). Finally, AAM seek to cross-appeal on the issue of whether the Court of Appeal was wrong to remit the AAM proceedings for reconsideration in relation to exemption under article 101(3) (the remission issue) [40]-[41]. The restriction issue The restriction issue raises two issues for consideration: (i) whether the Court is bound by the Mastercard CJ decision; and (ii) if not, whether that decision ought to be followed [48]. The appellants argue that the Court of Appeal was wrong to conclude that it was bound by Mastercard CJ to find that there was a restriction of competition in the acquiring market contrary to article 101(1) TFEU and equivalent national legislation because Mastercard CJ is factually distinguishable [68]-[72]. The Supreme Court concludes that Mastercard CJ is binding and the Court of Appeal was correct so to hold. The essential factual basis upon which the Court of Justice held that there was a restriction on competition in Mastercard CJ is mirrored in these appeals [93]-[94]. Even if the Court were not bound by Mastercard CJ, the Supreme Court would follow it and conclude that there was a restriction on competition in the present cases. The effect of the collective agreement to set the MIF is to fix a minimum price floor for the MSC. That minimum or reservation price is non-negotiable. Acquirers have no incentive to compete over it. It is a known common cost which acquirers know they can pass on in full and do so. Merchants have no ability to negotiate it down. A significant portion of the MSC is thereby immunised from competitive bargaining and is determined by collective agreement rather than by competition. By contrast, in the counterfactual, in which there is no MIF but settlement at par, the whole of the MSC is open to competitive bargaining and determined by competition [95]-[104]. The Court therefore dismisses the appeal on the restriction issue [105]. The standard of proof issue On the standard of proof issue, the appellants submit that the Court of Appeal was wrong to conclude that, in relation to article 101(3), there is a specific requirement for robust and cogent evidence, which is a more onerous standard than the normal domestic civil standard of proof on the balance of probabilities, and that there is a legal requirement for facts and empirical data [106]. It is common ground that to justify the restriction on competition the burden of satisfying that the four conditions set out in article 101(3) lies on the defendant; the present issue relates to the standard of proof [107]. Visa and Mastercard submit that in the Commercial Court proceedings the judges adopted diverging views on the standard of proof [108]. The Court of Appeal considered that EU law requires cogent factual and empirical evidence to satisfy article 101(3) [109]. The Court considers that the essential complaint made by Visa and Mastercard here does not relate to the standard of proof but rather to the nature of the evidence required to meet the standard of proof in this context and, more specifically, the type of evidence needed to establish that the benefits from the MIF rules under consideration outweigh the detriments to merchants [115]. In the Courts view, article 101(3) imposes requirements as to the nature of the evidence that can discharge the burden to establish an exemption under that provision, which is imported into domestic competition law by the 1998 Act. Cogent empirical evidence is required to carry out the required evaluation of the claimed efficiencies and benefits [116]. The Court therefore dismisses the appeal on the standard of proof issue [138]. The fair share issue On the fair share issue, Visa challenges the decision of the Court of Appeal, which interpreted Mastercard CJ as meaning that in a two-sided market situation such as in the present case, if the restriction causes disadvantages overall to the consumers in the market under consideration (here the merchants in the acquiring market), those disadvantages cannot be compensated by advantages to consumers in the other market (the cardholders in the issuing market), unless the two groups of consumers are substantially the same, which is not the position here [144]. The Supreme Court finds that the Court of Appeal arrived at the correct decision, albeit by different reasoning. The best available guidance from the CJEU on the application of the fair share requirement is the opinion of the Advocate General Mengozzi in Mastercard CJ, which considered that the fair share of the benefits must be received by the consumers in the same market. The Court therefore dismisses the appeal on the fair share issue [171]-[174]. The broad axe issue The broad axe issue relates to the degree of precision required in the quantification of mitigation of loss where a defendant to a claim for damages arising out of a breach of competition law asserts that the claimant has mitigated its loss through the passing on of all or part of an overcharge to its customers [175]. Mastercard submitted that it must prove that the merchants passed on some of the overcharge to their customers but the quantification of the pass-on did not have to be precise if precision could not reasonably be achieved [179]. The claims of the merchants in these appeals are for compensatory damages for loss caused to them by the tortious acts of Visa and Mastercard in breach of their statutory obligations under the 1998 Act [182]. In such circumstances, EU law allows a member state to lay down procedural rules governing actions that safeguard rights derived from EU law, provided the rules comply with the principles of equivalence and effectiveness. The only constraint on national law at the relevant time was the principle of effectiveness, which requires that the domestic rules do not make it practically impossible or excessively difficult to exercise rights guaranteed by EU law [188]. In the UK, pass-on is an element in the quantification of damages that is required by the compensatory principle and required to prevent double recovery through claims in respect of the same overcharge by a direct purchaser and by subsequent purchasers in a chain [196]-[197]. Visa and Mastercard have the burden of establishing that the merchants have recovered the costs incurred in the MSC but, once the defendants have raised the issue of mitigation, in the form of pass-on, there is a heavy evidential burden on the merchants to provide evidence [216]. The degree of precision requires a balance between achieving justice by precisely compensating the claimant and dealing with disputes at a proportionate cost [217]. The law does not require unreasonable precision in the proof of the amount of the loss that the merchants have passed on to suppliers and customers [225]. The Supreme Court does not interpret the Court of Appeal as having held that the defendants had to prove the exact amount of the loss mitigated, but insofar as the Court of Appeal required a greater degree of precision in the quantification of pass-on from Visa and Mastercard than from the merchants, the Court erred. As a result, the appeal succeeds on the broad axe issue [226]. The remission issue The cross-appeal relates only to the AAM proceedings [227]. AAM submit that the Court of Appeal erred in remitting the AAM proceedings for reconsideration of the exemption under article 101(3). Despite reaching the correct conclusion that Mastercards defence based on article 101(3) should have been dismissed, the Court of Appeal made an order remitting the AAM proceedings to the CAT, alongside the other two sets of proceedings, for reconsideration of whether Mastercards case under article 101(3) should have succeeded in whole or in part [232]-[233]. AAM submit that it was not open to the Court of Appeal to so order and to permit the issue to be re-opened by Mastercard, and that it offended against the principle of finality in litigation [235]. In the Supreme Courts judgment, the Court of Appeal was wrong to allow Mastercard to re-open this issue, which it had lost after a full and fair trial. It offends against the strong principle of public policy and justice that there should be finality in litigation [237]. Accordingly, AAMs cross-appeal is allowed [247].
