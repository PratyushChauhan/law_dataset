As to the first issue, the Employment Tribunal did not have the benefit of the later decisions in the European Court of Justice/Court of Justice of the European Union and in the High Court. That jurisprudence shows that a distinction must be drawn between the tests for justification in direct and indirect discrimination and regulation 3 should be read accordingly [51]. The aims set out in article 6(1) of the Directive are directed primarily to the Member States and are of a public interest nature, which is distinguishable from purely individual reasons particular to the employers situation, such as cost reduction or improving competitiveness [50(2)]. The Age Regulations had given employers and partnerships the flexibility to choose which aims to pursue, provided that (i) they can count as legitimate objectives of a public interest nature within the meaning of the Directive, (ii) they are consistent with the social policy aims of the state, and (iii) the means used are both appropriate to the aim and reasonably necessary to achieve it [55]. It is necessary to identify the actual objective being pursued, although it may not have been articulated or even realised when the measure was first adopted [59, 60]]. Once an aim has been identified, it has to be asked whether it is legitimate in the particular circumstances of the employment or partnership concerned [61]. Finally, the means chosen must be both appropriate and necessary to achieve that aim [62]. Two broad categories of aim had been accepted as legitimate by the European Court: inter-generational fairness and preserving the dignity of older workers [56, 57]. The three aims accepted by the Employment Tribunal in this case were consistent with article 6(1) of the Directive. Staff retention and workforce planning were directly related to the social policy aim of sharing out professional employment opportunities fairly between the generations. Limiting the need to expel partners by way of performance management was directly related to the dignity aim [67] (despite some reservations expressed about this aim generally [57, 58]).. As to the second issue, the wording of regulation 3 suggests that the focus is on whether the treatment of Mr Seldon (B) in particular was justified [63]. However, where it is justified to have a general rule, then the existence of that rule will usually justify the treatment which results from it. [65]. Often, requiring the application of the rule to the individual to be specifically justified would negate the purpose of having a rule in the first place [66]. However, all businesses will now have to give careful consideration to what, if any, mandatory retirement rules can be justified in their particular business [66]. The case is remitted to the Employment Tribunal to consider whether the choice of a mandatory age of 65 was a proportionate means of achieving the legitimate aims of the partnership [68].
