Ground (1): That the present situation might not have been foreseen by the legislature is not a reason for reading into clear legislation a specific exemption which would not reflect the scope of any exemption in EU law, especially when the foreign state could have invoked state immunity but did not do so in time [24, 25]. The USAs first submission is rejected [26]. Ground (2): Jurisdiction is primarily territorial in both international and domestic law [29-30]. TULCRA regulates the procedures for dismissal on the grounds of redundancy of employees at institutions in England, Wales and Scotland. The UK is not legislating extra-territorially when it covers proposals or decisions about domestic redundancies developed or taken abroad [31]. TULCRA contains no exception for such cases. The USAs submission would render largely otiose the procedures and time for a plea of state immunity. State immunity is an adjudicative bar separate from a foreign states underlying responsibility. The USAs case elides two distinct principles. [35-38]. This appeal concerns situations covered by TULCRA but falling outside EU law, so the USA cannot rely on EU law as entitling it to protection from discrimination [45]. Further EU law does not protect third country nationals from discrimination or therefore non-member states [46-47]. The USAs second submission is therefore also rejected [47]. Ground (3): The power conferred under s.2(2) of the 1972 Act to make delegated legislation for the purpose of dealing with matters related to any obligation of the United Kingdom under EU law envisages a close link between the content of any such legislation and the relevant obligation [61]. While each case must be considered on its merits, the domestic extension of an EU regime into areas outside or specifically excluded from that regime may well fall outside s.2(2) [66]. In the present case, however, Parliament had by its original enactment of TULCRA established a unified domestic regime drawing no distinction between different parts of TULCRA within or outside the EUs internal market competence. In these unusual circumstances, Parliament could be taken to have created for the domestic purposes of s.2(2) of the 1972 Act a relationship which the Secretary of State was entitled to take into account and continue by and in the 1995 Regulations [72]. The submission that the 1995 Regulations went beyond the Secretary of States powers in protecting employees of public administrative establishments without trade union representation would therefore also be rejected [77-73]. Lord Carnwath (dissenting) considers that the relationship between TULCRA and the Directive created by domestic statute has no obvious relevance to the purpose of the 1972 Act [94-95]. Some limitation is necessary to ensure that the power to legislate outside the normal parliamentary process is kept within bounds [96]. Lord Carnwath would dismiss the appeals on the first two issues, but allow the appeal on the third issue [100-101]. the Courts decision. It does not form part of the reasons for the decision.
