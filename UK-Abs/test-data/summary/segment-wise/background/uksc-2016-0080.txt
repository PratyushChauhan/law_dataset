PJS is married to YMA. Both are well-known individuals in the entertainment business. They have two young children. Between 2009 and 2011 PJS had a sexual relationship with AB and, on one occasion, with AB and CD. In January 2016 the editor of the Sun on Sunday newspaper, published by News Group Newspapers (NGN), notified PJS that he proposed to publish ABs account of the relationship. PJS issued proceedings claiming that the publication would breach his rights to privacy and confidentiality, protected by article 8 of the European Convention on Human Rights (ECHR). He applied for an interim injunction, to restrain publication pending the trial of his claim. This application required the court to balance PJSs article 8 rights with NGNs right to freedom of expression under article 10 ECHR, and was subject to s 12 of the Human Rights Act 1998 (HRA). Section 12(3) provides that an interim injunction can only be granted if a claimant is likely to establish at trial that publication should not be allowed. Section 12(4) provides that the court must have particular regard to the importance of freedom of expression and, in relation to journalistic material, to the extent to which the material has or is about to become available to the public, to the public interest in the material being published, as well as to any relevant privacy code. The High Court refused the application but the Court of Appeal allowed PJSs appeal on 22 January 2016 and granted an interim injunction which restrained publication of information which would disclose the identity of PJS and details of the sexual relationship. On 6 April 2016 ABs account was published in print in the United States, and thereafter in Canada and in Scotland, identifying PJS. As a result of representations by the appellants solicitors, publication was restricted to hardcopy editions and online publication was geo-blocked such that internet users in England and Wales could not readily access those sites. However, details have been published on a number of other websites and social media, although the appellants solicitors have been doing their best to remove offending URLs and web pages. On 12 April 2016 NGN applied to the Court of Appeal to set aside the interim injunction on the ground that, as the information was now in the public domain, PJS was unlikely to obtain a permanent injunction at trial and the interim injunction could therefore no longer be justified. On 18 April 2016 the Court of Appeal held that the injunction should be discharged. The Supreme Court restored it pending determination of PJSs application for permission to appeal, which it ordered to be heard with the appeal, should permission be granted.
