These three appeals concern requests for extradition under European arrest warrants (EAWs). The Lithuanian Ministry of Justice issued EAWs for Mindaugas Bucnys based on convictions for housebreaking and fraud and for Marius Sakalis based on his conviction for sexual assaults. The Estonian Ministry of Justice issued an EAW for Mr Dimitri Lavrov based on a conviction for murder. EAWs are warrants intended to meet the requirements of Council Framework Decision 2002/584/JHA on surrender procedures between member states of the EU (the Framework Decision). Within the United Kingdom, Part 1 of the Extradition Act 2003 (the 2003 Act) was enacted to give effect to the same requirements. Under section 2(7) of the 2003 Act the requests were, after receipt in this country, certified by the Serious Organised Crime Agency (SOCA) (now the National Crime Agency (NCA), the designated authority under section 2(8), as Part 1 warrants issued by a judicial authority of a category 1 territory having the function of issuing arrest warrants. The questions of principle raised by the present appeals are whether the requests are open to challenge on the basis that (i) they were not the product of a judicial decision by a judicial authority within the terms of the Framework Decision and/or of Part 1 of the United Kingdom Extradition Act 2003, and (ii) the ministries making them did not have the function of issuing domestic arrest warrants and were incorrectly certified by SOCA under section 2(7) of the 2003 Act. If a challenge is open on either or both of these bases, the third question is (iii) whether the challenge is on the evidence well-founded in the case of either or both of the Ministries. On 12 December 2012, the Divisional Court answered the first question affirmatively and the second negatively. As to the third, it concluded that a ministry of justice would, under European law, be regarded as a judicial authority for the purposes of issuing a conviction warrant if it was sufficiently independent of the executive for the purposes of making that judicial decision (para 98), and that, in this connection, the antecedent process, in the form of a request for the issue of a European arrest warrant coming from the court responsible for the conviction, was relevant. On the evidence before it, it held that the EAWs issued by the Lithuanian Ministry in respect of Mr Bucnys and Mr Sakalis were valid, while the EAW issued by the Estonian Ministry in respect of Mr Lavrov was invalid. Mr Bucnys and Mr Sakalis now appeal, while the Estonian Ministry appeals in the case of Mr Lavrov. During the appeal further evidence was adduced about the legal position and procedures in Lithuania and Estonia. Since the hearing, the Court has been informed by those instructed by Mr Bucnys that he has [regrettably] died. The issue remains of importance, and this judgment records the Courts conclusions on it.
