The Public Processions (Northern Ireland) Act 1998 (the 1998 Act) placed responsibility for the management of parades in Northern Ireland in the hands of an independent statutory body called the Parades Commission. The Act placed a duty on anyone proposing to organise a public procession to give advance notice to the police and made it a criminal offence to organise, or take part in, a public procession of which notification had not been given. On 3 December 2012 Belfast City Council decided to stop flying the Union flag over Belfast City Hall every day. The flag was to be flown on certain designated days only. The decision sparked a wave of protests by loyalists which continued for some months and became known as the flags protests. The protesters marched from a meeting point in East Belfast to Belfast City Hall in the centre of the city and back again. The route took the parade through the Short Strand, which is perceived to be a nationalist area, and where violence, disorder and sectarian abuse were directed at residents. No notification was made under the 1998 Act that a parade was due to take place. Initially, in order to prevent potential disorder, the police had taken the decision not to permit the protesters to enter Belfast City Centre. But between 6 and 8 December 2012 this decision was changed, as it was considered there was a need to try to facilitate some form of protest in order to ease community tension. Therefore, when the parades began on 8 December 2012 the protesters were permitted to enter the City Centre and pass through the Short Strand area. The weekly parades continued until March 2013, during which time the police took no action to stop them. The police made a number of public announcements to the effect that it had no power to stop a parade that had not been notified under the 1998 Act. They also tried, unsuccessfully, to refer the matter to the Parades Commission. The appellant, a resident of Short Strand, issued judicial review proceedings challenging the failure of the police to take action to prevent the parades from taking place. The High Court found that the police had failed to appreciate the extent of its powers to stop an un-notified parade, which had the effect of undermining the 1998 Act. The Court of Appeal allowed the Chief Constables appeal. DB appealed to the Supreme Court.
