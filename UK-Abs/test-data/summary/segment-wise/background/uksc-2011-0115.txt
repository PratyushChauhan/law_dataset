Section 6(1) of the Prosecution of Offences Act 1985 (the 1985 Act) recognises the right of a private person to institute and conduct a private prosecution where the duty of the Director of Public Prosecutions (the DPP) to take over them does not apply. But the right is subject to s.6(2) of the 1985 Act which confers upon the DPP a power, even when not under a duty to take over the proceedings, nevertheless to do so at any stage. In determining whether to do so, it is his policy to apply certain criteria, including in particular a criterion relating to the strength of the evidence in support of the prosecution. Prior to 23 June 2009, the DPP asked himself whether there was clearly no case for the defendant to answer. If such was his conclusion, he took over the prosecution and discontinued it; otherwise, subject to the application of further criteria, he declined to take it over. However, on 23 June 2009 he changed his policy in relation to the evidential criterion. In that regard it became his policy to take over and discontinue a private prosecution unless the prosecution was more likely than not to result in a conviction (the reasonable prospect test). In August 2010 the Appellant instituted two private prosecutions. On 16 November 2010 the DPP, acting by the Crown Prosecution Service (the CPS), took over and discontinued the prosecutions. The Appellant applied for judicial review of the decision to do so. His case was that the reasonable prospect test, adopted by the DPP on 23 June 2009, is unlawful. It is common ground that the application of the DPPs former evidential criterion would not have led to him to take over and discontinue the prosecutions. The Divisional Court of the Queens Bench Division of the High Court dismissed the application and the Appellant now appeals.
