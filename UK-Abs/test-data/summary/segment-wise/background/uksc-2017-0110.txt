This case is about the application of EU food hygiene rules to certain chicken and pork products manufactured by the appellant, Newby Foods Ltd (Newby). Specifically, the appeal concerns whether these products should be classified as mechanically separated meat (MSM) within point 1.14 of Annex I to EU Regulation No 853/2004 (the Regulation). Newby argues they should not be classified as MSM. The Food Standards Agency (FSA) contends that they should be so classified. It is now common for the butchering of animal carcases in the food industry across the EU to be carried out by machines. These often leave a significant amount of meat on the bone. Under the Regulation, there are two types of MSM: (1) high pressure MSM and (2) low pressure MSM. The specific hygiene requirements for both are set by paragraphs 3-4, Chapter III, Section V, Annex III in the Regulation. Further, MSM cannot count towards food meat content and attracts specific labelling requirements. MSM produced from lamb and beef bones is prohibited entirely under EU law. Consequently, the commercial value of MSM is much lower than that of other fresh meat products. Newby has developed a machine to remove residual meat from carcase bones. It uses this to process residual meat on beef, lamb and pork bones after the initial boning of the animal carcases and on chicken carcases after the breasts have first been removed by other mechanical processes. The Newby process has two stages: (1) meat-bearing bones are forced into contact to remove meat by shearing and (2) meat so removed is then passed through a machine producing a product similar to minced meat. Newbys meat product was previously known in the UK as desinewed meat (DSM). It was widely regarded as distinct from MSM, including by the FSA. DSM is not a category recognised in EU law. On 4 April 2012, following criticism by the Commission, the FSA issued a moratorium with the result that DSM could (1) no longer be produced from residual meat on beef and lamb bones and (2) only be produced from residual meat on chicken and pork bones if classified and labelled as MSM. Newby brought judicial review proceedings challenging the moratorium. On 16 July 2013, Edwards-Stuart J in the High Court made a preliminary reference to the Court of Justice of the European Union (CJEU) on the definition of MSM in point 1.14 of Annex I of the Regulation (point 1.14). The CJEU made a preliminary ruling on 16 October 2014 (the CJEU judgment). After the CJEU judgment, Newby abandoned its challenge to the moratorium as to lamb and beef carcases, but not pork and chicken. On 23 March 2016, Edwards-Stuart J concluded that the pork and chicken meat products resulting from stage (1) of Newbys process are not MSM. He also found that such DSM was not a product derived from bone scrapings. The Court of Appeal allowed the appeal and dismissed the challenge to the moratorium, but upheld the judges finding as to bone scrapings. Newby now appeals to the Supreme Court on the proper interpretation of point 1.14 in light of the CJEU judgment.
