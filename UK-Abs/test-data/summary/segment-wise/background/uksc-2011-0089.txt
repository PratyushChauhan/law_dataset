These appeals raise important and difficult issues in the field of equity and trust law. Both appeals raise issues about the so-called rule in Hastings-Bass, which is concerned with trustees who make decisions without having given proper consideration to relevant matters which they ought to have taken into account. In addition, the appeal in Pitt raises issues as to the courts jurisdiction to set aside a voluntary disposition on the ground of mistake. In 1985, Mr Mark Futter made two settlements. Initially, both settlements had non-resident trustees, until, in 2004, he and Mr Cutbill, both resident in the United Kingdom, were appointed. In 2008, on the advice of solicitors, Mr Futter and Mr Cutbill, in exercise of a power of enlargement, distributed the whole capital of the first settlement to Mr Futter, and, in exercise of a power of advancement, distributed 36,000 from the second settlement to Mr Futters three children in equal shares. In so doing, they overlooked the effect of section 2(4) of the Taxation of Chargeable Gains Act 1992 (TCGA), which resulted in a large capital gains tax liability for Mr Futter, and a modest one for his children. Mr Futter and Mr Cutbill, as trustees of the two settlements, applied to have the deed of enlargement and the deeds of advancement declared void, which Norris J held them to be on the basis of the rule in Hastings-Bass. In 1990, Mr Derek Pitt suffered very serious head injuries in a road traffic accident, resulting in his mental incapacity. Mr Pitts claim for damages for his injuries was compromised by a court-approved settlement in the sum of 1.2m. Mr Pitts solicitors sought advice from Frankel Topping, a firm of financial advisers. They advised that the damages should be settled in a discretionary settlement. This was done in 1994 by the establishment of the Derek Pitt Special Needs Trust (the SNT). The SNT could have been established without any immediate inheritance tax liability, but it was not. The report from Frankel Topping made no reference whatsoever to inheritance tax. In 2007, Mr Pitt died. His personal representatives, who were also two of the trustees of the SNT, commenced proceedings to have the SNT set aside, which the deputy judge ordered on the basis of the rule in Hastings-Bass. However, in so doing, he indicated that, even if there had been a mistake of any sort, it was only a mistake as to the consequences of the transaction, rather than its effect, and so he would not have granted rescission of the SNT. The Revenues appeals against these decisions were heard together in the Court of Appeal. Lloyd LJ (with whom Longmore and Mummery LJJ agreed) (i) allowed the appeals, principally on the ground that the rule in Hastings-Bass was not applicable, because the respective trustees acted reasonably in reliance on what they supposed to be competent professional advice, (ii) dismissed Mrs Pitts appeal based on mistake, on the basis that rescission for mistake could only be granted if there was a serious mistake as to nature of a transaction, rather than its consequences, and a mistake as to tax consequences was not a sufficient mistake for the purposes of rescission.
