Mr Holden accidentally set fire to his car while repairing it at the premises of his employer, Phoenix Engineering. The fire caused 2 million of damage to Phoenix and its neighbours premises. Phoenixs insurer (Axa) paid out and has agreed not to pursue Mr Holden personally for the money, but only his car insurance provider (Churchill). Axa says that Mr Holden is covered by his car insurance policy's third party liability cover but Churchill says he is not. Clause 1a of the policy says we will cover you for your legal responsibility if you have an accident in your vehicle and: you kill or injure someone; [or] you damage their property . As required by law, the policy also includes a certificate that it satisfies the requirements of relevant legislation, which includes the Road Traffic Act 1988 (RTA). Under the RTA, car insurance policies must provide cover in respect of any liability incurred in respect of damage to property caused by, or arising out of, the use of the vehicle on a road or other public place. The High Court held that the policy did not cover Mr Holden's accident because it had arisen out of the negligent way in which it was being repaired and not out of the use of the car. The Court of Appeal (CA) allowed his appeal. It held that the wording of clause 1a was inadequate and had to be read with the certificate that the policy provided the cover required by law. As the policy had no geographical limitations, no such limitations were to be imposed in extending its cover to meet the statutory requirements. It accordingly construed the opening words of clause 1a to mean we will cover you for your legal responsibility if there is an accident involving your vehicle.
