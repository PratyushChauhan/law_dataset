The present appeal is from Guernsey, where there is no equivalent of the 2006 Act. The common laws of England and Guernsey are agreed to be identical in this area. The principal issues are: (1) whether the reasoning in Barker still applies in Guernsey [8], and means that an employers liability insurer covering an employer for only part of the period during which the employer exposed a victim is liable for only a pro rata part of the employers liability to the victim [9], and (2) if Barker does not apply and the position in Guernsey is now the same as in the UK under the 2006 Act, whether such an insurer is liable in the first instance for the whole of the employers liability to the victim, and (3) if so, whether the insurer has pro rata rights to contribution from any other insurer of that employer and/or from the employer in respect of any periods not covered by the insurer [9]. There are parallel issues regarding such an insurers responsibility for defence costs incurred in meeting the victims claim.  For 27 years from 1961 to 1988, Mr Carr was negligently and consistently exposed to asbestos dust by his employer, Guernsey Gas Light Co Ltd (GGLCL). He later contracted mesothelioma, from which he died [10]. Before his death, he sued the Respondent (IEG), as successor in title of GGLCL, and recovered compensation of 250,000 damages and interest plus 15,300 towards his costs. IEG also incurred defence costs of 13,151.60 [11]. During the 27 years of exposure GGLCL had two identifiable liability insurances, one with Excess Insurance Co Ltd, for two years from 1978 to 1980, the other with Midland Assurance Ltd, for six years from 1982 to 1988 [12]. The Appellant (Zurich), as successor to Midlands liabilities, maintains that it is only liable to meet 22.08% of IEGs loss and defence costs, based on the fact that Midland only insured GGLCL for 6/27ths of the 27-year period of exposure [14]. The trial judge ordered Zurich to meet 22.08% of the compensation but 100% of defence costs. The Court of Appeal ordered Zurich to pay 100% of both the compensation and defence costs [15]. Zurich appeals in relation to both compensation and defence costs.
