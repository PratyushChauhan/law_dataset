Wolverhampton City Council (the Council), in its capacity as the local planning authority, granted planning permission for four blocks of student accommodation in proximity to a site used for storage of liquefied petroleum gas (LPG). Three of the four blocks of student accommodation had been completed, but work on the fourth had not commenced. Concerned that the LPG storage facility in the vicinity constituted a danger to human life, the Health and Safety Executive (the HSE), a statutory, non-departmental public body, applied for an order to revoke or modify the planning permission under section 97 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (the Act). In refusing the application, the Council took into account its liability to pay compensation under section 107 of the Act were it to revoke planning permission in respect of all four blocks, but it did not consider whether the application should be granted only in respect of the fourth block. The HSE brought judicial review proceedings challenging, among other things, the Councils decision not to revoke or modify the planning permission. The High Court refused that part of the claim. The Court of Appeal allowed the HSEs appeal, holding that it was irrational for the Council to fail to consider whether to exercise its powers under section 97 so as to prevent the construction of the fourth block alone. The Councils decision was therefore unlawful and it was ordered to reconsider the matter. However, the Court of Appeal held by a majority (Pill LJ dissenting) that a decision under section 97 of the Act was to be taken not in isolation but within the statutory framework of the Act which imposed a liability to pay compensation if an order was made under the section. Accordingly, the Council, when reconsidering the matter, would be entitled to take into account its liability to pay compensation under section 107 of the Act. The HSE appealed to the Supreme Court against this part of the decision of the Court of Appeal: the issue being whether it is always open to a local planning authority, in considering under section 97 of the Act whether it appears to be expedient to revoke or modify a permission to develop land, to have regard to the compensation that it would or might have to pay under section 107.
