The question in this appeal is whether there is a requirement for the prosecution to prove a defendant had an absence of belief that the person they were having sexual intercourse with was over the age of 13, before they can be convicted of an offence of unlawful carnal knowledge of a girl under the age of 14. The appellant, who was 17 years old at the time, had sexual intercourse with a 13 year old girl. Initially the girl informed her mother of this fact but told her the intercourse had not been consensual. The appellant was arrested. Subsequently however, the girl withdrew the allegation and admitted the sex had been consensual. As a result, the appellant was charged with the offence of having unlawful carnal knowledge of a girl under the age of 14 contrary to section 4 of the Criminal Law Amendment Acts (Northern Ireland 1885-1923) (the 1885 Act) - a serious offence that carries a maximum of life imprisonment. The appellant was represented and pleaded guilty to the charge at Belfast Crown Court in 2004. He was sentenced to 3 years detention in a Young Offenders Centre, suspended for 2 years. He had pleaded guilty on the understanding that it was no defence to a charge under section 4 for the defendant to show he believed the girl was over the age of 13. Following his conviction the appellant received advice from different solicitors and launched an appeal, arguing that the Crown was indeed required to prove that the appellant did not believe the girl was over 13 years old. The appellant argued before the Northern Ireland Court of Appeal that section 4 was silent as to such a defence but in view of the legislative history and its seriousness, it must be presumed that there is a mental element to the offence. The appellant relied on the general presumption that criminal offences require the prosecution to prove mens rea i.e. some intent on the part of the accused, unless explicitly excluded by the language of the statute or necessarily inferred from the language of the offence. Such a presumption is hard to displace, especially in relation to serious offences. The Court of Appeal rejected the appellants arguments and held that no defence of reasonable or honest belief existed. All that was necessary was for the prosecution to prove the accused had had sex with a girl who was actually under the age of 14. The appellant thus appealed to the Supreme Court.
