The issue arising in the appeal is whether the appellants have satisfied the threshold conditions set out in section 1(6) of the Equal Pay Act 1970 (the Act) in order to bring claims alleging that they are employed under less favourable terms and conditions than certain male employees of the respondent council who do work of equal value. The appellants have to establish that the male employees are in the same employment as they are, notwithstanding the fact that they are employed on different terms and conditions at different establishments from the appellants. The appellants are 251 classroom assistants, support for learning assistants and nursery nurses employed during school term-time in the respondents schools under terms contained in a national collective agreement known as the Blue Book. The appellants wish to compare their terms and conditions with those enjoyed by a variety of full time manual workers employed by the respondent, as groundsmen, refuse collectors, refuse drivers and a leisure attendant (the comparators), under a different collective agreement known as the Green Book. The comparators are entitled to a substantial supplement on top of their basic pay, whereas the appellants are not. The issue of whether the appellants are in the same employment as the comparators was determined in a pre-hearing review. The Employment Tribunal ruled that they are, because the appellants could show that if the comparators were employed at their establishments they would be employed under broadly similar terms to those under which they are employed at present. The Employment Appeal Tribunal allowed an appeal by the respondent on the ground that the appellants could not show that there was a real possibility that the comparators could be employed in schools to do their existing jobs. The Court of Session held that this was the wrong test, but that the appellants still failed on the evidence to show that if the comparators were to be based at schools they would be employed on Green Book terms and conditions. The appellants appealed to the Supreme Court.
