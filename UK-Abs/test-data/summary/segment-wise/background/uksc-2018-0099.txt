This appeal concerns the permitted uses of a retail store in Streatham in the London Borough of Lambeth. Planning permission was granted by the Secretary of State in 1985, but the use was limited by condition to sale of DIY goods and other specified categories, not including food. The permitted categories were extended by later consents (under section 73 of the Town and Country Planning Act 1990 (the 1990 Act)). The most recent was in 2014, which is in issue in this case. In that permission, the proposed new wording for the permission included: The conditions in the 2014 permission did not refer to the restriction on the sale of food goods, or to conditions in the previous permission from 2010. The second respondent (Aberdeen Asset Management) sought a certificate from the appellant Council determining that the lawful use of the store extended to sales of unlimited categories of goods including food. A certificate to that effect was refused by the Council, but granted by a planning inspector on appeal, on the basis that no condition was imposed on the 2014 permission to restrict the nature of the retail use to specific uses. This was upheld by the lower courts. The Council, as the local planning authority, appeals to this court.
