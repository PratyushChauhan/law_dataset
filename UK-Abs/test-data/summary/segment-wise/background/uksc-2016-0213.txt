This appeal arises out of a case where a professional gambler, Mr Ivey, sues a casino, Crockfords, to recover his winnings at Punto Banco. Mr Ivey claims for his winnings in circumstances where Crockfords refused to pay out because it believed Mr Ivey cheated. The appeal raises questions about the meaning of the concept of cheating at gambling and the relevance of dishonesty to that concept. Punto Banco is a variant of Baccarat and is not normally a game of skill. The different odds applied to certain bets mean that the casino enjoys a small advantage, taken over all the play. In Punto Banco at Crockfords it was 1.24% if the player wins and 1.06% if the banker wins. Edge sorting is possible when the manufacturing process of playing cards causes tiny differences to appear on the edges of the cards so that, for example, the edge of one long side is marginally different from the edge of the other. It is possible for a sharp-eyed person sitting close to a card shoe (the holder that dispenses the playing cards) to see which long edge it is. This information becomes useful only if things can be arranged so that the cards which the gambler is most interested in are all presented with one long edge facing the table, whilst all the less interesting cards present the other long edge. Then the gambler knows which kind of card is next out of the shoe. Using edge sorting to identify high value cards in Punto Banco will give the player a long-term edge of about 6.5% over the house if played perfectly accurately. On 20 and 21 August 2012, Mr Ivey and his associate, Ms Sun, played Punto Banco at Crockfords. Mr Ivey openly admits to the use of edge sorting during this game. Mr Ivey asked the senior croupier that the same shoe of cards be re-used if he indicated to him that he won. Ms Sun (affecting superstition) asked the croupier to turn the cards in a particular manner if she indicated they were good or not good. The croupier had no idea of the significance of what she was being asked to do. In consequence, the long edge of the not good cards were oriented in a different way from the long edge of the good cards. This procedure was followed for each game of Punto Banco until the shoe was finished. Mr Ivey then indicated that he had won with that shoe and so the cards were reshuffled. The use of a machine shuffler ensured that the cards were shuffled without rotating any of the cards. Mr Ivey could now identify high value cards and his betting accuracy increased sharply. Mr Iveys total winnings over the two days was 7.7m. Nine days after play, Crockfords told Mr Ivey they would not pay his winnings because the game had been compromised. The High Court held that Mr Iveys use of edge sorting was cheating. The Court of Appeal upheld this finding.
