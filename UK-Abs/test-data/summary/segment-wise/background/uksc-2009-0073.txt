The appellants were convicted of serious criminal offences after trials in which the victims of the offences did not give evidence: in one case because he had since died and in the other because she had run away in fear when the trial was about to commence. In each case a statement from the victim was admitted pursuant to s 116 Criminal Justice Act 2003 and placed before the jury.

On 5 June 2009 the Panel of the Grand Chamber adjourned consideration of that request pending the judgement of the Supreme Court in this case.
