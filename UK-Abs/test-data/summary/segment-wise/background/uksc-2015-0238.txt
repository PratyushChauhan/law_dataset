The issue in this appeal is the role of the Court of Protection where there is a dispute between the providers or funders of health or social care services for a person who lacks the capacity to make decisions for himself and members of his family about what should be provided for him. N is a profoundly disabled man, now in his twenties, who is part of a large, close and loving family. His disabilities require that carers are in attendance throughout the day and night. His parents have been unable to co-operate with the authorities in meeting his needs and a care order was made in respect of N when he was eight. This necessarily came to an end when he was eighteen. Shortly before that point, the local authority issued proceedings in the Court of Protection seeking orders pursuant to the Mental Capacity Act 2005 (the MCA) that it was in Ns best interests for N to reside in a care home and for contact with his parents to be regulated and supervised by the local authority. Responsibility for his care passed to the National Health Service when he turned 18. It was not in dispute that N lacked the capacity to make decisions about his residence or contact with his family, nor that for the time being the care home provides a safe and settled environment for N. By the time of the hearing the issues between Ns parents and the respondent clinical commissioning group had narrowed to whether N could visit the family home and whether his mother could assist care home staff with his intimate care when she was visiting him there. The respondent considered that neither was in Ns best interests: the first would require additional trained carers which it was not prepared to fund, and the care home staff had concerns about the second, after the parents had declined an offer of the necessary training in manual handling. At the hearing the respondent argued that the Court of Protection, on Ns behalf, could only decide between the available options and that it was inappropriate to try to obtain a best interests declaration to put pressure on the respondent to make further funding available. The judge agreed that she could not consider the parents proposals for this reason, and she declared that the contact plan proposed by the respondents was in Ns best interests. The Court of Appeal upheld the judges decision.
