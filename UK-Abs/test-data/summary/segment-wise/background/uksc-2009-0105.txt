E challenged JFSs (formerly the Jews Free School) refusal to admit his son, M, to the school. JFS is designated as a Jewish faith school. It is over-subscribed and has adopted as its oversubscription policy an approach of giving precedence in admission to those children recognised as Jewish by the Office of the Chief Rabbi of the United Hebrew Congregation of the Commonwealth (the OCR). The OCR only recognises a person as Jewish if: (i) that person is descended in the matrilineal line from a woman whom the OCR would recognise as Jewish; or (ii) he or she has undertaken a qualifying course of Orthodox conversion. E and M are both practising Masorti Jews. E is recognised as Jewish by the OCR but Ms mother is of Italian and Catholic origin and converted to Judaism under the auspices of a non-Orthodox synagogue. Her conversion is not recognised by the OCR. Ms application for admission to JFS was therefore rejected as he did not satisfy the OCR requirement of matrilineal descent. E challenged the admissions policy of JFS as directly discriminating against M on grounds of his ethnic origins contrary to section 1(1)(a) of the Race Relations Act 1976 (the 1976 Act). Alternatively, E claimed that the policy was indirectly discriminatory. The High Court rejected both principal claims. The Court of Appeal unanimously reversed the High Court, holding that JFS directly discriminated against M on the ground of his ethnic origins. JFS appealed to the Supreme Court. The United Synagogue also appealed a costs order made against it by the Court of Appeal.
