This appeal relates to a compensation scheme (the Scheme) set up in 1999 by the Department for Trade and Industry to provide tariff-based compensation to miners employed by the British Coal Corporation (British Coal) who suffered from a medical condition called vibration white finger (VWF) as a result of excessive exposure to vibration through the use of vibratory tools. The Scheme provided for compensation to be paid for pain, suffering and loss of amenity (General Damages) and handicap on the labour market and other financial losses including past and/or future loss of earnings (Special Damages), which could include a services award to cover the need for assistance in performing specified domestic tasks. Rather than conducting an individual assessment of each claimants ability to carry out the specified tasks, the Scheme applied a presumption based on the condition reaching a certain level of severity. Mr Arthur Watkins was employed by British Coal as a miner from 1964 until 1985 and had developed VWF by the early 1980s. In 1999 he instructed the appellant to act for him in relation to a claim under the Scheme. Findings from a medical examination and interview indicated that Mr Watkins could obtain General Damages and qualified for the presumption in his favour that he satisfied the requirements for a services award. Mr Watkins sought a services award. In 2003 he was instead offered the tariff award for General Damages in full and final settlement of his claims. The appellant wrote to Mr Watkins on 18 February 2003 reporting the offer. After a telephone conversation with an employee of the appellant, Mr Watkins accepted the offer. In 2008, Mr Watkins instructed new solicitors to bring a claim against the appellant for professional negligence, on the basis that as a result of the appellants negligence Mr Watkins had lost the opportunity to bring a services claim under the Scheme. Mr Watkins died in 2014 and his daughter, Mrs Jean Edwards, was appointed to continue the claim on behalf of his estate. The first-instance court held that the letter of 18 February 2003 and the advice given had been negligent and that had Mr Watkins received appropriate advice he would probably have rejected the offer and pursued his services claim. A jointly instructed medical expert, who had been instructed not to apply the presumption that would have applied under the Scheme, provided a report that concluded Mr Watkinss symptoms would have been insufficient to succeed on a services claim. The court therefore held that Mr Watkins had suffered no loss and dismissed the claim. Mr Watkins successfully appealed to the Court of Appeal, which decided that the trial judge had been wrong to determine the value of the services claim on the basis of evidence that would not have been available at the time of the notional claim. The appellant seeks to appeal that decision. The issue in the appeal is whether, in assessing the prospects of success of the negligence claim, the court should have taken account of the further medical report.
