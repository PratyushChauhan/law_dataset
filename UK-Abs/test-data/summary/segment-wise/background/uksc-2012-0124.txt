The issue in the appeal is whether the definition of terrorism in the Terrorism Act 2000 includes military attacks by non-state armed groups against national or international armed forces in a non-international armed conflict. Mr Gul was convicted by a jury of five counts of disseminating terrorist publications, for which he was sentenced to five years imprisonment. The offence was created by section 2 of the Terrorism Act 2006, which defines terrorist publications as including publications which are likely to be understood as a direct or indirect encouragement to the commission, preparation, or instigation of acts of terrorism. Terrorism is defined in section 1 of the Terrorism Act 2000, as the use or threat of action, inside or outside the United Kingdom, (a) involving serious violence against a person, involving serious damage to property, endangering another persons life, creating a serious risk to public health or safety, or designed to seriously interfere with seriously disrupt an electronic system; (b) designed to influence a government or intergovernmental organization or to intimidate the public or a section of the public; and (c) made for the purpose of advancing a political, religious, racial, or ideological cause. The publications in question included videos which Mr Gul posted on YouTube showing (i) attacks by members of al-Qaeda, the Taliban, and other proscribed groups on military targets in Chechnya, and on the Coalition forces in Iraq and in Afghanistan, (ii) the use of improvised explosive devices against Coalition forces, (iii) excerpts from martyrdom videos, and (iv) clips of attacks on civilians, including the 11 September 2001 attack on the United States. These videos were accompanied by commentaries praising the bravery, and martyrdom, of those carrying out the attacks, and encouraging others to emulate them. The Court of Appeal refused Mr Guls appeal against conviction and sentence. His appeal to the Supreme Court was based on a challenge to the conclusion of the Court of Appeal (arising from a direction given by the trial judge following a request from the jury) that the definition of terrorism included military attacks by non-state armed groups against national or international armed forces in their territory.
