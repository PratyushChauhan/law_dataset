The appellant, DN, is a Rwandan national who was granted refugee status in the UK pursuant to the 1951 Refugee Convention on 26 October 2000. He was subsequently convicted in the UK of a number of offences, the most serious of which occurred on 22 January 2007 when he pleaded guilty to assisting the unlawful entry of a non-EEA (European Economic Area) national in the UK contrary to section 25 of the Immigration Act 1971 (the 1971 Act). He was sentenced to 12 months imprisonment for the Immigration Act offence and two months consecutively for each of three pecuniary advantage offences making a total sentence of 18 months imprisonment. The Secretary of State for the Home Department has powers, under the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 (the 2002 Act) to order the deportation of persons convicted of serious offences. Section 72(4)(a) of the 2002 Act provides that a person shall be presumed to have been convicted of a particularly serious crime and to constitute a danger to the community of the United Kingdom if s/he is convicted of an offence specified by order of the Secretary of State. The Secretary of State specified several offences which were said to be particularly serious crimes by way of the Nationality, Immigration and Asylum Act 2002 (Specification of Particularly Serious Crimes) Order 2004 (the 2004 Order). Assisting unlawful immigration contrary to section 25 of the 1971 Act was included among them. At the conclusion of DNs imprisonment on 2 July 2007, the Secretary of State made a decision to deport DN, based on s. 72(4)(a) of the 2002 Act: DN was presumed, on the basis of the 2004 Order, to have been convicted of a particularly serious crime and to constitute a danger to the community. On 31 January 2008, the Secretary of State, using his powers of administrative detention conferred by Schedule 3, paragraph 2(3) of the 1971 Act, ordered DNs detention pending deportation. DN brought a claim for judicial review of the deportation order. Following a stay and the decision in EN (Serbia) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2009] EWCA Civ 630, [2010] QB 633, which determined that the 2004 Order was unlawful, DN amended his judicial review proceedings to concentrate on the lawfulness of the detention. Following a further stay and the decision in R (Draga) v Secretary of State for the Home Department [2012] EWCA Civ 842, where the Court of Appeal ruled detention lawful even where based on an unlawful deportation order, the Court of Appeal dismissed DNs substantive appeal.
