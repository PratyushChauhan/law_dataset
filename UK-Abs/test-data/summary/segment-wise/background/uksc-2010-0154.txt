The issue in this case is whether an employment tribunal has jurisdiction in relation to individuals who are resident in Great Britain and employed by a British company but who travel to and from home to work overseas. The Appellant is a UK company based near Aberdeen, which is one of about 70 subsidiary or associated companies of Halliburton Inc., a US corporation. It supplies tools, services and personnel to the oil industry. Mr Ravat lives in Preston, Lancashire, and is a British citizen. He was employed by the Appellant from April 1990 until May 2006, when he was made redundant. He complains that he was unfairly dismissed. At the time of his dismissal he was working in Libya. The question is whether the employment tribunal has jurisdiction to consider his complaint. Mr Ravats employment documentation described him as a UK commuter. He worked for 28 consecutive days in Libya, followed by 28 consecutive days off at home in Preston. He was job- sharing, working back-to-back with another employee. Some of the Appellants employees were accorded expatriate status, but that was not done in Mr Ravats case because he did not live abroad full-time. His travel costs were paid for by the Appellant. The work that Mr Ravat carried out in Libya was for the benefit of a German associated company of Halliburton Inc. His salary was paid in Sterling to a UK bank account, and he paid income tax and national insurance on the PAYE basis. An employment tribunal sitting in Aberdeen held that it did have jurisdiction. That decision was set aside by the Employment Appeal Tribunal. Mr Ravat appealed, and the Inner House of the Court of Session allowed the appeal. The Appellant now appeals to the Supreme Court.
