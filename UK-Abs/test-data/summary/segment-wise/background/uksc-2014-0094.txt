A patient, who was clinically asymptomatic at the time, requested that his GP refer him for a heart screen on 30 May 2008. The GP referred him for an electrocardiogram (ECG) test in July 2008. The test reported negative for ischaemic heart disease, and no further action was taken. The patient made further complaints of chest pain to a locum doctor on 10 December 2008, and so his GP referred him to a chest pain clinic 5 days later. The clinic declined to see him because of his earlier negative test, and sent a report to the practice on 20 December, which was not marked urgent or reviewed. The patient attended the practice again on 6 January 2009 enquiring as to why he had not received an appointment. The GP referred him for another ECG, but the patient died of a myocardial infarction later that day. The patients widow complained to the Northern Ireland Commissioner for Complaints (the Complaints Commissioner). Following an investigation, the Commissioner held that the practice had failed to provide a reasonable level of care and treatment and was guilty of maladministration. He recommended that the GP make a payment of 10,000 to the widow. The GP refused to make the payment, and so the Commissioner indicated that he would lay a special report about the matter before the Northern Ireland Assembly. The Commissioners recommendation was upheld at first instance but quashed by a majority of the Court of Appeal. The Commissioner appealed to the Supreme Court.
