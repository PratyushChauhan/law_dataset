The issue in this appeal is whether AA falls within the definition of an adopted child in paragraph 352D of the Immigration Rules. AA was born in Somalia on 21 August 1994. Her family were torn apart by events in Somalia and her father was killed in the mid-1990s. AA became separated from her mother and other siblings during the fighting. Around the end of 2002, she went to live with her brother-in-law, Mohamed. He had a daughter, Fadima and step-daughter, Amaani. Mohamed took AA into his family home under the Islamic procedure known as Kafala (described as a process of legal guardianship akin to adoption). In October 2007, Mohamed left Somalia and came to the UK in November 2007. He was granted asylum on 21 July 2008. The three girls, AA, Fadima and Amaani, were left with a maternal aunt in Mogadishu. An application for entry into the UK was made for all three girls. Entry clearance was granted to Fadima and Amaani who came to the UK in January 2010. It was refused for AA who remained in Addis Ababa pending her appeal. Her appeal was heard in the First-tier Tribunal (FTT) on 3 September 2010. Exert evidence, accepted by the tribunal, was to the effect that, although adoption as such does not exist under Islamic law, under the legal institution known as Kafala a person may become a protg and a part of the household of an adult; and that this only falls short of a full blown adoption in that such adoptee does not enjoy a right of inheritance under Islamic law. The FTT allowed the appeal both under paragraph 352D and article 8 ECHR (right to respect for private and family life). The Secretary of State appealed. The Upper Tribunal (UT) allowed the Secretary of States appeal in respect of paragraph 352D but confirmed the FTTs decision under article 8. On 2 May 2012, the Court of Appeal confirmed the UTs decision. On 14 May 2012, AA was given entry clearance and she arrived in the UK on 4 June 2012. AA appeals to the Supreme Court in respect of paragraph 352D of the Immigration Rules.
