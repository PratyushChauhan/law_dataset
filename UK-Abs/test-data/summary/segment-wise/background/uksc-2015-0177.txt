Littlewoods overpaid VAT to HMRC between 1973 and 2004. Between 2005 and 2008, HMRC repaid the principal sum of 205 million, together with simple interest of 268 million. In these proceedings, Littlewoods seek additional interest, calculated on a compound basis as 1.25 billion, on the ground that such interest is due under the common law of restitution, either as restitution for a mistake of law, or as restitution of tax unlawfully demanded (a Woolwich claim). The two issues for the Supreme Court in the present case are: (1) Whether Littlewoods common law claims are excluded by sections 78 and 80 of the Value Added Tax Act 1994 (the 1994 Act) as a matter of English law, and without reference to EU law. The lower courts found that Littlewoods common law claims were barred by the 1994 Act. Littlewoods appeals on this issue; (2) If Littlewoods claims for compound interest are excluded by sections 78 and 80 of the 1994 Act, whether that exclusion is contrary to EU law, in light of the Court of Justice of the European Unions (CJEU) judgment in Case C-591/10 Littlewoods. The lower courts found that denying compound interest was contrary to EU law. HMRC appeals on this issue. Other issues were raised, but these would only need to be decided if Littlewoods were successful on either of the first two issues.
