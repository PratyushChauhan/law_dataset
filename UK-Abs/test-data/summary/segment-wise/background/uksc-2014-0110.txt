This appeal concerns a repayment of overpaid value added tax (VAT) of approximately 125m (the VAT Repayment) received by the appellant, Shop Direct Group (SDG), a company in the Littlewoods corporate group (the Group). Over a number of years, companies within the Group made substantial overpayments of VAT to HMRC. These VAT overpayments were made on an incorrect understanding of law: the VAT was wrongly calculated when goods were sold to agents of the supplier with a discount for commission. The relevant supplies were made between 1978 and 1996 by companies within the Group, including SDG. VAT was paid to HMRC in relation to these supplies by the representative member of the Group under section 43 of Value Added Tax Act 1994 (VATA 1994). By 2007, following a series of reorganisations within the Group, each of the companies which had made relevant supplies had permanently discontinued its trade. In June 2003, the representative member of the Group made a claim for repayment of VAT from HMRC under section 80 of VATA 1994. This claim included the various payments which led to the VAT Repayment. In September 2007, HMRC made the VAT Repayment pursuant to arrangements which resulted in the VAT Repayment being received by SDG as beneficial owner at the time of receipt. The issue before the Supreme Court is whether the VAT Repayment is liable to corporation tax under the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 (ICTA, later rewritten in the Corporation Tax Act 2009). Sections 103 and 106 of ICTA imposed a charge to corporation tax on post-cessation receipts from a trade, profession or vocation. These provisions and their statutory predecessors were enacted to prevent tax avoidance by businesses choosing when to discontinue a business in order to escape tax on post-cessation receipts [1, 3-9]. In the proceedings below, the First-tier Tribunal, Upper Tribunal and Court of Appeal all held that SDG was liable to corporation tax on the receipt of the VAT Repayment.
