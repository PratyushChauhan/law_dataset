This appeal is the lead case in a number of appeals concerned with liability to pay National Insurance Contributions (NICs) and, in particular, with the interpretation of the phrase in section 6(1) of the Social Security Contributions and Benefits Act 1992, [w]here in any tax week earnings are paid to or for the benefit of an earner. The case focuses on the meaning of the word earnings in that phrase, and whether it covers a payment by the appellant, FML, of an employers contribution to a Funded Unapproved Retirement Benefits Scheme [1]. The scheme was set up by FML by trust deed on 11 April 2002 to provide certain benefits to its employees and directors. The trust provided that upon a members retirement from service the trustees were to apply the accumulated fund in providing the member with a pension for life or such other relevant benefits as might be agreed. On the members death the trustees were to realise the accumulated fund and apply the net proceeds to or for the benefit of a defined discretionary class of beneficiary. On the same day, Mr McHugh, a shareholder and director of FML, asked to become a member of the scheme. He informed the trustees that he wished them to exercise their discretion in favour of his wife in the event of his death. FML made an initial cash contribution to the scheme of 1,000 and transferred to it Treasury Stock with the nominal value of 162,000, both for Mr McHughs benefit. He has been the only member of the scheme and has received no relevant benefits from it, as defined in section 612 of the Income and Corporation Taxes Act 1988 [2]. He was 54 years old when the transfers were made, and FML specified his retirement age to be his 60th birthday. However as he controlled FML this date could be brought forward for the purposes of the scheme [3]. The question was whether the transfers were payments of earnings to or for the benefit of Mr McHugh within the meaning of section 6 of the 1992 Act. It was agreed that the payment was for his benefit, but was it earnings? HMRC decided that it was, and that FML was therefore liable to pay Class 1 NICs on the value of the transfer. FMLs appeal to the Upper Tribunal was successful, but the Court of Appeal reinstated HMRCs decision [4-5]. FML appealed to the Supreme Court. Departing from its position before the Court of Appeal, FML accepted that earnings had a wider meaning than emoluments in income tax legislation. It submitted that the payment of earnings under section 6 did not extend to the employers transfer to a trust of funds or assets in which the earner had at the time of the transfer only a contingent interest [6].
