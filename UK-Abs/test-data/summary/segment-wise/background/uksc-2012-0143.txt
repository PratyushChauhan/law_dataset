This appeal concerns the principle that an individual extradited to the UK to face trial may only be tried for crimes allegedly committed before the extradition if those crimes form the basis of the extradition request (the specialty principle), and its application to contempt of court proceedings. In 2009 Mr OBrien came under investigation on suspicion of involvement in a large-scale scheme to defraud investors, commonly known as a boiler room fraud. On 24 September 2009 the Common Serjeant of London made a restraint order against him under section 41 of the Proceeds of Crime Act 2002 (POCA). This order required Mr OBrien (amongst other things) to make disclosure of his assets, not to remove assets from England and Wales, and to return to England and Wales within 21 days any moveable asset in which he had an interest outside England and Wales. The order contained a penal notice, warning Mr OBrien that if he disobeyed the order he could be found to be in contempt of court. Mr OBrien disobeyed the order and fled to the United States. On 18 December 2009 the Common Serjeant found that he was in contempt and issued a bench warrant for his arrest. Mr OBrien was traced to Chicago. The Serious Fraud Office (SFO) sought his extradition to face charges relating to the alleged boiler room fraud. Mr OBrien consented to his extradition on 8 October 2010. Since there was a concern that the outstanding bench warrant could complicate the extradition, the SFO applied to the Common Serjeant to set aside the bench warrant, which he did on 18 November 2010. Mr OBrien was returned to the UK on 2 December 2010. He was arrested, charged with various fraud offences, and remanded in custody. Meanwhile the SFO had reviewed its concerns about the contempt allegation, and re-applied to the Common Serjeant for Mr OBriens committal for contempt. Mr OBrien challenged the courts jurisdiction to hear the application. That challenge was rejected by the Common Serjeant and by the Court of Appeal. Mr OBrien now appeals to the Supreme Court on two grounds, namely that: On the correct construction of the Extradition Act 2003, the specialty rule applies to any extradition offence, defined as conduct occurring in the UK and punishable under the law of the UK with imprisonment or detention for 12 months or more (by reference to ss. 148 and 151A of the Extradition Act 2003 (the 2003 Act)). Mr OBriens contempt satisfies these criteria and so falls within the specialty rule; or In the alternative, Mr OBriens contempt of court is a criminal contempt constituting a criminal offence, and so falls within the specialty rule.
