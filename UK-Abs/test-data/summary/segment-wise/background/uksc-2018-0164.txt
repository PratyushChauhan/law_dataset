In this appeal, the Supreme Court is asked to decide whether Barclays Bank is vicariously liable for sexual assaults allegedly committed between 1968 and about 1984 by the late Dr Gordon Bates. Dr Bates was a self-employed medical practitioner with a portfolio practice. His work included conducting medical assessments and examinations of prospective Barclays employees. Barclays required job applicants to pass a pre-employment medical examination as part of its recruitment and employment procedures. Barclays arranged the appointments with Dr Bates and provided him with a pro forma report headed Barclays Confidential Medical Report. Dr Bates was paid a fee for each report; Barclays did not pay him a retainer. If the report was satisfactory, the applicants job offer would be confirmed, subject to satisfactory GCE examination results. Dr Bates conducted the (unchaperoned) medical examinations in a consulting room at his home. It is alleged that Dr Bates sexually assaulted the 126 claimants in this group action during their medical examinations. After Dr Bates died in 2009, the claimants sought damages from Barclays. At first instance, the judge held that Barclays is vicariously liable for any assaults that Dr Bates is proved to have perpetrated. The Court of Appeal agreed and dismissed Barclays appeal. Barclays now appeals to the Supreme Court.
