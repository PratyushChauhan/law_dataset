The Respondent was vaccinated on 3 November 1992 with a vaccine (the Product) manufactured in France by a French company, now known as Aventis Pasteur SA (APSA). On 18 September 1992 APSA sent a consignment of the vaccine, including the Product, to its then wholly-owned subsidiary, Aventis Pasteur MSD Ltd (APMSD), in England. APMSD acted as a United Kingdom distributor for APSAs products. APMSD received the consignment on 22 September 1992 and sold part of it, including the Product, on an unknown date. The Product was eventually used to vaccinate the Respondent. On 1 August 2001 the Respondent began proceedings under section 2 of the Consumer Protection Act 1987 (CPA) against APMSD, alleging that the Product was defective and had caused him brain damage. On 16 October 2002 the Respondent issued separate proceedings against APSA also under section 2 of the CPA. Relying on section 11(3) of the Limitation Act 1980 (the LA) and Article 11 of Council Directive 85/374/EEC of 25 July 1985 (the Directive), APSA defended this action on the basis that it had been raised more than ten years after APSA had put the Product into circulation, which APSA alleged was 22 September 1992 at the latest. Broadly, Article 11 provides that there is a ten-year time-limit for initiating proceedings against the producer (as defined in the Directive) of a product. Faced with this defence, the Respondent sought an order that APSA be substituted as a defendant in place of APMSD in the proceedings against APMSD, relying on section 35(5)(b) and (6)(a) of the LA. These provisions allow a new party to be substituted for a party whose name was given in any claim made in the original action in mistake. APSA contended that, in so far as English law permitted such substitution after the expiry of the time-limit, it was inconsistent with Article 11. The High Court made a preliminary reference to the European Court of Justice (ECJ). So far as the power to substitute one producer for another as defendant was concerned, the House of Lords (to which the case eventually came) could not reach a unanimous view as to the effect of the ECJs judgment. The House of Lords therefore referred the question back to the ECJ. The answer returned by the ECJ is now clear: once ten years have passed since a producer put a product into circulation, that producer cannot be sued unless proceedings have been taken against it within the ten-year period. The Respondent now accepts that he cannot use section 35 of the LA as a basis for substituting APSA for APMSD as the defendant in the present proceedings. The Respondent submits, however, that in its judgment the ECJ indicated a different basis on which he can actually make the desired substitution, namely, that in proceedings instituted within the ten-year period against the wholly-owned subsidiary of the producer, that producer can be substituted for that subsidiary if the domestic court finds that the putting into circulation of the product in question was, in fact, determined by that producer. The dispute between the parties therefore turns on the interpretation of that part of the ECJs judgment.
