Lord Reed begins by questioning whether the way the case has been approached by the courts below and in the parties printed cases is correct [5 7].
Instead of viewing the representation as an event whose legal consequences were fixed at the time when the statement was made, Lord Reed concludes that the case in fact concerns a continuing representation capable of remaining in effect until the contract is concluded [31].
The representation contained in the critical email was undoubtedly of a continuing nature so long as Mr Erskine remained the prospective contracting party [24].
In principle, the possibility that a representation may continue to be asserted, and may have a causative effect so as to induce the conclusion of a contract, is not necessarily excluded where, as here, the contracting parties are not the original representor and representee.
The inference can be drawn from the parties conduct that they proceeded with the negotiation and conclusion of the contract on the basis that the accuracy of the representation continued to be asserted by the representor, implicitly if not expressly, after the identity of the prospective contracting party had changed.
In such circumstances, the representation could continue to have a causative effect, so as to induce the conclusion of the contract [25].
Where the inference to be drawn is that a representation continued to be made until the contract was concluded, it may also be inferred that the risk of harm being suffered as a result of reliance upon it, in the event that it was inaccurate, continued to be foreseeable.
In such circumstances, the representor may be taken to have assumed responsibility for the accuracy of the representation towards the contracting party who relied upon it, even where he is not the original representee [26].
Just as a representation may continue up to conclusion of the contract when made by a companys agent prior to the commencement of his agency, it may have the same effect where the person to whom it is addressed becomes the agent of the contracting party [27 28].
In this case, the negotiations simply continued after it became apparent that an LLP was to be used as the vehicle for Mr Erskines investment.
Neither party drew a line under the previous discussions, disclaimed what had previously been said or sought assurance that it could be relied upon as between the contracting parties [30].
In continuing and concluding the contractual negotiations with Cramaso, through its agent Mr Erskine, without having withdrawn the representation earlier made to him as an individual, the respondents by their conduct implicitly asserted to Cramaso the accuracy of that representation.
It continued to be foreseeable that the representation would induce the other party to the negotiations to enter into a contract.
The respondents therefore assumed a responsibility towards Cramaso for the accuracy of the representation and owed it a duty of care, which they failed to fulfil [31].
Cramaso is entitled to recover damages for any loss suffered as a result, under section 10 of the Law Reform (Miscellaneous Provisions) (Scotland) Act 1985 [32 43].
In a concurring judgment, Lord Toulson rejects the respondents argument that it was necessary for Cramaso to show that, at the time of the critical email, Mr Lewis knew or ought to have known that there was a high degree of probability that Mr Erskine would be sent the email and would rely upon it.
The situation where a statement is made by one party to another, who in turn relies upon it in entering a contract with a third party is different to the present situation, where a statement was made during contractual negotiations by one prospective party to another in relation to the very transaction about which they were negotiating [51].
Lord Toulson agrees with Lord Reed that the fact the representation was negligent rather than fraudulent does not affect its continuing nature; what matters is its continuing potency as an inducing factor [63].
The case will have to return to the Court of Session for further procedure in relation to remedies [44].
